I’ve known it for years.” — Harry PotterMost seventeen-year olds don’t view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds haven’t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every Potterhead’s questions — and then some. Not only does Deathly Hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of Devil’s Snare, Harry’s best mate Ron bellows “HAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?” Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him “Are you a wizard, or what?” thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes Rowling’s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.Harry’s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote Harry’s last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret “shout-out” to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that “neither shall live while the other survives”, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. More than any of the other Potter books, Deathly Hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by Voldemort’s Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. This is not to say that Deathly Hallows doesn’t offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isn’t all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but Rowling’s farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied.","Jul 02, 2007"

I wish this series would go on forever!I don't know how I've gone through my life without these books. I regret not reading it when I was younger, but I am so happy that I finally did, better late than never, right?The world built in these books is so real and tangible, it is truly a masterpiece. The characters are engaging and brilliant, and I love how the plot is so interwoven and twisted within itself, especially in this last book.I was taken by surprise when I started the series, I didn't think it would pull me in as it did. As I kept reading through the books, the characters slyly stole my heart. Now, having finished the last line, I am flooded with emotion. This series is more than a story or words on a page, it is magic.","Jun 21, 2014"
"9780545010221","992038","Tara","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/992038-tara","Ok, before I start a few warnings. This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because I really didn't like this book.Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them.But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them.Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb.The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish? And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves. And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there.","Mar 13, 2008"

"9780545010221","4426615","Jason","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4426615-jason","This is just a pithy review on the Harry Potter series as a whole. It is not an in-depth analysis of the work in general, nor is it a review on any one particular installment.Harry Potter is a work of art. I got made fun of once¹ when I was out to dinner with some friends, because while we were discussing these books I made the mistake of referring to them as “literature.” I felt like I had to defend that assertion because, although the definition of literature is pretty broad, it seems like it should really only apply to works with some definable qualitative value or literary merit. In this case, my friends were wrong—Rowling explores themes and concepts in this series that I think are valuable to children and young adults who look to her characters for qualities they seek to emulate, and I believe her works will have lasting impact on this and future generations.I’ve heard it said before that everything you need to know you’ve learned in kindergarten. Well, that might be somewhat of an oversimplification, but I do think children or young adults who grow into this series, seeing Harry and his friends mature as they themselves mature, can glean some pretty important life lessons from it. They are impressionable human beings who are learning about themselves and are starting to make the choices that reflect the kinds of people they want to be.So what does Harry Potter teach them? Well, here is a bullet list of what it has taught me. And if you’re good, I’ll think about turning this into a PowerPoint presentation. Or maybe not.• The quality of your character is not a reflection of where you come from or who your parents are; rather, it is a reflection of the choices you make, so make them wisely.• The way you treat other people, especially those less fortunate than you, reveals your true colors more quickly and more completely than almost anything else you do.• It is a good thing to have dreams and ambitions, but that alone is not enough. You cannot expect success without effort.• It is far less important what your abilities are than what you actually do with them. Your abilities alone do not define you.• Nobody likes to fail, but to refuse an attempt at success on the grounds that you’re afraid to fail is failure in itself.Growing up is about figuring out who you are and coming to terms with your strengths and weaknesses, and it is about deciding how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses in order to become a better person. It’s a lifelong struggle, but it starts early, and I think Harry Potter offers the tools to help achieve that. It can help young people find their way, and maybe that’s an oversimplification for a seven-volume series of novels, but that’s what I got out of it, and that’s why I will recommend this to my kids as they start to become ready for some life lessons of their own.¹This is misleading; I’ve been made fun of countless, countless times.","Oct 16, 2010"

Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley’s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the channels to his heart’s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling to remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost.

I can't believe how that book fit everything we're all been asking about since the very early beginning ,and some of the facts that anyone wondered about like How the trace dedicate the underage magic, Why we can't just create food from thin air, or why there was a Taboo on saying ""Voldemort""'s name..and so more.It dive deeply into the past of important characters we thought we know enough , Dumbledore and Snape.From the beginning you see a wrapping up for the characters,the places -like Private Drive- and the events.. you'll see a lines that connected to the very early of the series and book one..you'll be in a journey toward the ending without feeling disconnected from the whole previous events and characters.There's no something you'll feel-if u pay enough attention - out of place ,out of the plot or out of the characters .The Characters **************Was so glad that J.K.Rowling announce that there's no ""new"" character presented in the last books which was perfect since it's the end of the series and it's better to focus on our beloved characters and the ones we lived wit them for years.The characters deals here with the ""real responsibilities"" that comes with the coming of age. or the quest they asked for and they have to do for their good and greater goodThere were no any ""Exaggeration"" or over acting, the characters go normally ,naturally and very real, The writer chose to describe even the smallest feelings they feel in some important situations like for example Harry's final visit to the Dark Forest, or the boredom of the days on the run from place to place.And won't forget the wrapping up of Every character sometimes with surprises which is never out of character.She was always have it all planned and well drawn The Message ***********I have to admit at my second reading I find an extraordinary spiritual amazing messageIt starts with the 2 quotations one is pagan, and one is from a Christian tradition.. one about the Death and one about Friends..and it fit perfectly to the theme of the book,and the message of Love that can beat any other force.I saw also a symbol in the Dumbledore's character and the whole Harry -Dumbledore's relation, complicated symbol of Faith, religion and religious people. in many ways that you have to look carefully to dedicate it.ِِAnd look at the final fight between Harry and Voldemort ..I was like..My God you're the best writer EVER
“You’re right. But before you try to kill me, I’d advise you to think about what you’ve done. . . . Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle. . . .” “What is this?” Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had shocked Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes whiten. “It’s your one last chance,” said Harry, “it’s all you’ve got left. . . . I’ve seen what you’ll be otherwise. . . . Be a man . . . try . . . Try for some remorse. . . .”  It's not just normal fight between Good and Evil , It's amazing written novel.Can't seriously describe all of what I want to say about this series Just one thing I can admit,It's my wonderful journey, It's my friends, It's the books that made me- trying to be- a better person. It's where I meet my friends.. It's where I truly Laugh while reading/living the story..It's where I cry with characters and feel sorry for some. It's magic..It's real magic cause It's words of LoveSo glad to finish it at 2nd May, And so strange I didn't feel I'm going to miss the Harry Potter books although I finished it before in Arabic, and that was the ending of my experience with it in English, But deep inside me is sure I'll go back to Hogwarts again ,re-reading from one to seven soon ISA.Before I finish I have to share this great man's word..Who really was the best transforming a paper character to a real life Thank you Joanna Rowling.

"9780545010221","11375137","Cait (Paper Fury)","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11375137-cait-paper-fury","Wheeeeeere do I even start with this? WHERE. Every human and their bobcat has reviewed this book, but I'M GONNA ANYWAY BECAUSE MY THOUGHTS ARE IMPORTANT. (I am also a Slytherin, FYI.) I'm also really angry because I'm giving it 5-stars because it's so freaking clever. But I've got complaints. But HECK. Life is short. Eat dessert first. Give books 5-stars. But I feel emotionally manipulated by this sneaky paperback, DARN YOU HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS. MY LOVE FOR YOU IS COMPLICATED.First: let's talk about why Cait is a Grumpy Gills:• The fact that the pacing is rubbish. Sorry?! But it kind of is. The beginning borderlines B.O.R.I.N.G. Not enough that I wasn't interested? But enough that I was annoyed. It felt like JK Rowling didn't know what to do with her characters if they didn't have Hogwarts classes to get to.• I'm annoyed that the Slytherins were still labelled at the end as ""badies"". C'mon. Honestly?! Especially in that epilogue when (view spoiler)[Ron (hide spoiler)] says ""don't make friends with Slytherins, kids!"" I mean. Rubbish and growls. (I am a defensive Slytherin, FYI.)• And speaking of Slytherin's...I kind of thought Harry and Draco might've (view spoiler)[made up or something?? Been tentative friends????? BUT NO??!?! (hide spoiler)] Apparently all the stuff I'd gleaned from the internet is wishful thinking. Heh.• There was VERY cliche Voldemort-must-monologue-before-his-kill scene.• To be realistic...Harry should've passed out from FOOD DEPRIVATION. Why is not one angry about this?!? The lad barely EVER ATE. I was hungry reading this blasted book. Someone give the kid a scone before he kills a thing.• I'm annoyed Luna and Neville didn't get more page time. REALLY annoyed.• I still don't ship the ships. In bk6 I was totally onboard with Harry and Ginny. But now? Meh. They like have no chemistry, sorry. And Hermione and Ron? LET. ME. LAUGH. No. Still...no. Though Ron did mature a lot in this book and I am proud. ...okay. My wrath is out. Now time for the FEEEEEEELS. Don't say I didn't warn you.EVERYTHING I FREAKING LOVED AND THE REASONS THIS BOOK IS GETTING 5 FREAKING STARS OMG FEELELLELELELELS:• My darling baby Neville Longbottom. No joke. I HAD A DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT. (I have not seen any movies, btw.) But my motorbike had broken down and he came and fixed it for me and it was adorable and my heart melted. I want a Neville Longbottom, please and thank you. MY CRUSH. <333 (Note: I do not own a motorbike. Nor would I want to. I would probably die on it, geesh, brain, where are you coming up with this stuff?)• The plot is clever. Okay seriously IT IS CLEVER. I loved how things tied in and tied up and I loved all the ""reveals"" and it was just clever.• And the world building is my favourite as always. I want to live a Hogwarts. BUT DOESN'T EVERYBODY?• Professor MacGonagall. Because she gives life. She is everything. All my love for Professor MacGonagall and her terrific dialogue lines, okay?“Our Headmaster is taking a short break,"" said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window.• I love Harry. I really do. Like at the end there, he was almost a little too perfect, which was boderline irritating? But he is a precious little piece of pumpkin juice and I LOVE how he makes mistakes and sometimes needs slapping with a broomstick, but at the end of the day he's just a GOOD KID. Likey.• Obviously Hermione. <3 And I'm glad Ron grew up a lot in this book, because gee that kid was 3 centimetres away from getting his nose punched by moi.• I hate hate hate hatttttte when the word ""bitch"" is used in a derogatory way towards women. But. There was this scene with Molly Weasley and Bellatrix LeStrange = and I liked it. YOU KNOW THE ONE, FOLKS.• Snape. Omg. Snape. I do agree that his a very complex character and I LIKE that. But I still hate him. Why? Because he could've done EVERYTHING just how he needed too -- sans bully children. I get why he hated Harry. I would've hated Harry if James had been like that (question: why the hell did Lily marry James?!??! Seriously?! HE SUCKED) but Neville?! Why did Snape pick on Neville so bad? He literally traumatised my darling baby and I shall not forgive him. I do not ""like"" Snape but I like the complexity of his story. And I kind of wish there as a book about Snape. His backstory seemed too rushed.• THE DEATHS. <3 Okay that sounds marginally sadistic. But hear me out. I hate when big battle finales keep all the ""favourites"" alive. It's dumb and unrealistic. There need to be deaths, and I think HPatDH did it really well. I got all tied up in knots several times. SNIFFLES. • I love Luna. She is an amazing special creature and I wish she was in the books more.• Speaking of which...I have to admire how ALL the characters are just so epic. I would seriously read spin-off series on anyone of them. THAT takes skill to write even secondary characters so the reader is invested.• I LIKED IT EVEN THOUGH IT KINDA MANGLED FEELS AND IT FRUSTRATED ME. But it surprised me! When I thought I'd seen all the spoilers of ever. And I was emotionally invested. Omg. I WAS.• (No tears though. I am a Vulcan.)*** ABOUT THAT EPILOGUE ***Okay but, spoilers about the finale below. (view spoiler)[I am twitchy about the finale. I thought there'd be more. All we know is who married who and how many kids they had and what STUPID names they gave their children. And Harry's son James is basically Harry's father reincarnated. Does that not disturb anyone? *raises hand*But what did Harry and Ginny do? Like did they get a Killed Voldemort Pesnion and get to retire? Did Harry become an Auror? Why the HECK didn't he get to teach in school? I think he'd been an awesome Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.Did Lunar and Neville marry?Or did Neville save himself for me?What did George do, sans Fred? Like, could George exist without a Fred?Why did Hermione settle so low when she married Ron?What happened to Kreecher? I want to hug Kreecher. I also want him to bring me a sandwich too.Did Professor MacGonagall stay in school to teach or did she scream when she saw Harry's children and say ""I QUIT""?....I am kind of angry there are no answers to these. Let me huff. (hide spoiler)]Aaaaand...I'M DONE. What else do I say? Yes. I loved it. YES. I love this series. I had a rocky start, and I thought it was dumb. But seriously? If I'd been reading this as a kid. I would been obsessed. OBSESSED. As is, I really want to own the books just for the sake of it because they're good and they're amazing and they deserve the world-wide cult fandom. It's a satisfying and grand and perfectly wretched finale and I should like to cheer enthusiastically.Omg, look at me. I'm a little HP fangirl. IT'S OVER FOR ME. I'VE REACHED THE POINT OF NO RETURN. “Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”(Also that quote means so much to me I cannot even.)","Jan 20, 2014"

Not just the books, but we kinda aged with him (or thereabouts). It's a coming of age story for our whole generation, whether or not we received our Hogwarts letters.And we were there together. We were at midnight release parties and movie theaters, lined up and excited to share in the adventure. I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over these stories--people who I wouldn't have thought to have much in common with in the first place. We came from all different backgrounds, much like the 4 houses, and joined in the Battle of Hogwarts.We mourned the deaths of beloved characters.And cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others.We debated what Harry should have done with the Elder Wand.But we never let go of this world. We continue to relive these memories through fan fiction, arts and crafts, music, food and drink, and theme parks.Being that it came out nearly a decade ago, I think it holds up pretty well.","Apr 01, 2013"

It was the end of an era, and then it wasn't.I can't express how thankful I am, for this series, for this world, for the magic, power and love behind J. K. Rowling's words. I don't know what I would be without Harry Potter.It's crazy how much time I spend reading the books, listening to the audiobooks, watching the films or just thinking about them. So many things between thousands of pages and millions of words. No wonder Harry Potter has such an impact on our society, as it deals with so many topics that have moved, and still move us today, will move us in future:Race and racism for one, hate, ignorance, arrogance and how to fight all of these things. Power and influence of the media, slavery, dictatorship, revolution, feminism, depression, death, loss, equality, love, friendship.J. K. Rowling is probably one of the most important teachers to every child (and adult) reading her books. She shows us, that our dreams are dreamed to become real, that family is who we chose our family to be, that friends can be our greatest strength and that every being, whatever our differences might be, deserves kindness and respect.I still can't believe that this amazing woman was able to put all of this in seven books.Thank you.Find more of my books on Instagram","Apr 02, 2015"

Please feel free to physically fight me. (And no, “AVPM wouldn’t exist without the series” is not a valid argument, because duh.)https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...God, what an unexpected result this is. Let's talk about it for six pages. I loved Half-Blood Prince so much that I postponed finishing the series for five months. More context: I started rereading this series in December, I was done the sixth book in February, and I didn’t pick up the finale until July.I thought this book was going to destroy me!!!And, like, it almost did. But not in the oh-my-god-this-amazing-series-is-over-cry-cry-cry way I expected. More like I, too, divided my soul into horcruxes, and they, like Voldemort’s, were being taken out at an excruciatingly slow pace over the course of 784 pages. Just weakening infinitesimally and kind of being like, can you just get this over with already? But instead of, you know, my actual self being killed, it was my enthusiasm for this series and any appreciation I may have had for JK Rowling.Seriously, I feel like any love I had for a couple of the books in this series has been brutally, torturously, painstakingly extinguished.This book was a CHORE.Let’s talk about why (for an extraordinarily long time).(Like all of my Harry Potter reviews, this is nothin’ but spoilers.)PLOTYou saw those glorious GIFs. You know the concept for the first half of this book is Not Great.The storyline is already, like, What if we just sat around in the most depressing on Earth for a few hundred pages, jumping locations every day, having the same conversation repeatedly, and granting our readers in-depth analyses of the gross fish we’re eating? (Sorry, British people, but I think we can all agree that a freezing/damp moor is no tropical vacation.) (Also shoutout to the time when Harry, Ron and Hermione overheard other wizards saying “Accio salmon” in order to eat and were just like, That information’s going straight in the mental trash can.)But then on TOP of it, the pacing is so!! horrible!! Nothing happens, and then something will happen and take literally no effort by the golden gang. Like when a thing they need just SHOWS UP in a frozen pond. How exciting. So glad I waded through hundreds of pages of freezing moor bickering to get to this point.Also, the bickering is legitimately the same three conversations over and over and over and over.HAHAHAHA. I just remembered that the seventh book was divided into two movies. LITERALLY WHAT WENT DOWN IN THE FIRST MOVIE?? Hahahahaha. Oh man. I am just never going to watch those adaptations, probably.I’m almost grateful that this book was so bad. Because now I never have to be sad it’s over! I do so much better with anger.CHARACTERSLike every young woman with a semi-functional brain, I’m big into Hermione. Or I was, for the first five or six books, before she was completely ruined and it was like she was never goddamn helpful or smart in the first place.IN OTHER WORDS, WHY DID J.K. ROWLING DO HERMIONE LIKE THIS?In this book, Hermione totally ignores logic in order to: a) stare lustily after Ron (Ron! Can you believe it?? We’ll get to that), b) sustain the stupid arguments that keep cropping up between the supposedly-golden trio, c) also maintain the TOTALLY USELESS ROMP THROUGH THE BRITISH COUNTRYSIDE, and d) ignore the good ideas that are exclusively coming from Harry presumably just in order to extend the book.Which, speaking of, this book is just the goddamn Harry Potter show. He comes up with every single plan, everyone at Hogwarts defers to him like he’s Team Good's Voldemort, and the whole book he’s treated like this misunderstood genius, too smart for the world around him.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAGNIFICENT SIXTH-BOOK CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT FOR GOD’S SAKE.Ron also sucks. He is constantly complaining and picking fights. He offers exactly zero (0) good ideas throughout the book. Legitimately all he does is try to be funny AND NOT BE. I cannot believe the (usually) fab Hermione was handed off to him like some sort of prize for the biggest pumpkin at the state fair.The only character who got what they were owed in this book was Neville. Which, if I had to pick one character to get the best ending, that’s who it would be, BUT STILL. His perfection is no excuse. He’s barely even in the f*cking books. Impossible to mess up.And I missed Dumbledore soooo muuuuuch but then he showed up (in death or quasi-death - this book is stupid and we’ll get to it) AND TALKED TO HARRY FOR EIGHT HOURS AND IT DIDN’T FEEL LIKE HIM ONCE. It was just sh*tty writing and plot exposition and explanation. How DARE you use Dumbledore as a plot point.Wow, I am especially bitter today.ROMANCEEVERY SINGLE ENDGAME ROMANCE IN THIS WHOLE SERIES IS THROWN TOGETHER AND BAD. I will go through each and explain this.Harry and Ginny: Ginny is so cool in the sixth book. So cool that I took back all of the Ginny-sh*t talking I did for approximately four years. I was even open to the concept of Harry/Ginny (even their ship name must be awful, no? Hinny? OH MY GOD I AM PRAYING IT’S “Garry”) just based off of Ginny’s apparent greatness. BUT NO IT’S JUST BAD. Harry spends a significant chunk of this already-boring book moping about Ginny. And it couldn’t be less cute. It’s just I miss Ginnyyyyyyyyy overandoverandoverandover without any mention of like, who she is. Or what their relationship is like. OR ANYTHING. It’s just J.K. Rowling being like, Oh, Harry would probably miss Ginny. Here’s a substance-less reminder.Ron and Hermione: like...areyoukiddingme. Not even Joanne and her terrible Twitter account are pro-Ronmione. They could NOT be less compatible. They are not fun together at all. My last words will be WHY NOT HERMIONE AND FRED. (I will scream them, which will be very startling to the loved ones who may be gathered around my hospital bed.) And no, Joanne, Harry and Hermione are not the correct answer. SERIOUSLY HOW IS HER TWITTER ACCOUNT THIS BAD. HOW DOES SHE HAVE SO MANY REGRETS ABOUT THE DUMB CHILDREN’S SERIES SHE WROTE 15 YEARS AGO.Lupin and Tonks: I don’t...I don’t even...when do they interact? When did this happen? How am I supposed to even support this? Isn’t Lupin a million years old? A shabby sloppy old were-man? Isn’t Tonks a young hottie? Also, literally how f*cked up is it that everyone thinks Tonks is like mourning and blaming herself when actually she’s all, “Why won’t Lupin loooooooove me.” Dumb.Lily and James: This one makes literally NO sense. Just because your BFF calls you a racial slur doesn’t mean you have to f*ck and then marry his bully. James sucks. Just because Snape somehow sucks even harder doesn’t mean that James’s dreamy green eyes override his TENDENCY TO BE THE WORST PERSON IN THE MAPPED UNIVERSE. (Second-worst.)Are there any more? Actually, scratch that. If there are more I do not want to recall.WHERE IS THE GODDAMN LOGIC. SOMEONE FIND IT AND HAND IT BACK TO JOANNEOne, don’t just KILL CHARACTERS TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR BOOK SEEM SAD AND POWERFUL. A good writing strategy is definitively not, “Oh, guess what, the stakes are high. How do you know? Um, I’ll just...kill these 14 people. Who matter a lot to you nerds I guess. How crazy, it’s almost like I’ve emotionally manipulated you into building a devotion to these works of fiction for the entirety of your child and made a literal billion dollars off it! But this book has already been super boring? No time to mourn!!! Sorry! Whatever, bye!”You can literally watch my progression into convincing myself that J.K. Rowling is a full-on real-life witch over the course of this review. And not a Hermione type of witch. A Wizard of Oz Wicked-of-the-West witch. A Salem witch trials witch. But CAN YOU BLAME ME. She’s a billionaire with nothing better to do than tweet about the project she keeps pretending she can move past!!! But she can’t!!! Because she keeps writing stuff! Is a billion dollars not enough? Can you release your stupid 90-page ebooks for not-money??? I am FURIOUS. And also sleep-deprived.But back to the stupid stuff. Well, the other stupid stuff.The sh*t that goes down in this book makes literally no sense at all. Dumbledore even says, “You and Voldemort have traveled into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested,” which is really Joanne saying, “I have really f*cked up this time. Wow, I have no clue how this makes even a magical sense of logic of my own creation. Um, what if...can I just not explain it?”Here’s one example of how dumb this is. Voldemort survives death continuously because there’s a piece of him in Harry, which supposedly “dies” when Harry dies. This is somehow the only part of Harry that isn’t, like, resurrected, but whatever. There is then in turn a piece of Harry (or Lily’s protection force-field thingy) within Voldemort, which is what keeps Harry alive. SO WHEN VOLDEMORT DIES, HOW DOES HARRY SURVIVE???? THIS MAKES NO SENSE NO SENSE AT ALL AND YES I REALIZE I’M THE TECHNICAL-ADULT TRYING TO READ LOGIC INTO WIZARD-DEATH BUT IF JOANNE, WHO IS A MILLION YEARS OLD, IS ALLOWED TO STAY IN THIS WORLD FOREVER THEN I’M ALLOWED TO DO THIS.Fair is fair.SNAPEI am barely controlling the section of my Harry Potter-related fury that is dedicated toward the pond monster/anthropomorphized dumpster/human Port-a-Potty/damp sock that is called Severus Snape. (It actually makes up 84.6% of my Potter-anger, so you ain’t seen nothing yet.)All I will say is that there is a Snape rant coming, but I am almost frightened to write it. I think when I start typing I may transform into some sort of anger-monster. In four stages. Duh. Like the cover of an Animorphs book.I’m going to go drown my sorrows in A Very Potter Musical now.Bottom line: The number one item on my bucket list is “get in an Internet fight with J.K. Rowling.” AVERAGE SERIES RATING: 3.57 starsQUESTION: Should I read Harry Potter and the Cursed Child???-------------------------whoops, my hand must have slipped. either that or this book was garbàge.regardless, i'll never admit to being wrong. ever. in my life. i am always correct and perfect and infallible. that's actually in the fine print of the contract you agree to when sending me a friend request.

  To you, yes you, reader of this review
, should you decide to read this review from beginning up to the very end, I offer you my deep thanks for your resilience, bravery and loyalty for this may be one of the longest reviews you’ll ever read on Goodreads. You still have time to back out though, so don’t tell me you haven’t been warned.^^
  To J.K. Rowling, 
there is no argument about your brilliance. You are a certified genius, a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and I can’t praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life. But you’re still human and surely you’ve recognized your flaws. One of which is your penchant for killing your characters. You can’t blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to. I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death of (view spoiler)[Fred! (hide spoiler)]. Why? Why kill him? Haven’t you killed enough already? Why did he even have to die?! Why not Percy instead? (kidding). I honestly think no Weasley should have died for obvious reasons I don’t think I still have to enumerate. Also, I honestly believe the last book lacks at least 200 more pages. Why jump to 19 years later epilogue right after the devastating war? Don’t the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them? A simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss? I have gone so far, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue. Also, don’t you think (view spoiler)[Professor Severus Snape (hide spoiler)] deserved a better, more respectful way to die? And whatever happened to (view spoiler)[Professor Moody’s (hide spoiler)]body? So you see, even though I admire you with 99.72 percent of my heart, .28 percent percent is resenting your choices. But thank you. Now my heart is tougher and braver. Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldn’t shed a tear. I just wish I read your books before Allegiant and Mockingjay. I probably would have considered those happy endings.
  To Harry Potter
, I will never forget your brave and pure heart. You showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage, trustworthy instincts and strength of will, oh and of course, a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can. 
  To Hermione Granger 
, you are the most kick-ass heroine I’ve ever met without needing to actually kick ass. You only needed your intellect, level headedness and kind heart and like Ron said, without you and your beaded bag, he and Harry would not have survived a day during your quest.
  To Ron Weasley
, you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most. I admire your loyalty, sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for Hermione than you. 
  To Fred and George
, when in tears, I could always count on you guys for a good laugh. It's no fun without you. (view spoiler)[George, it’s hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too. Oh Gaaaaawd! *wails*  (hide spoiler)]
  To Hagrid (and Graupy) 
, *hugs* I’ll never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes! Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and bravery. You will be remembered for generations. 
  To Professor Snape,
you are indeed the bravest of them all. Your sacrifice is utterly selfless and certainly the biggest of all. Your memories Harry and I saw in Dumbledore’s Pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and I spent days and nights crying for you. You're a true hero and you deserve a monument. Maybe I'll name my son after you. *wails*
  To Professor Dumbledore
, you are the true epitome of sacrifice, love and humility. You find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving.
  To Dumbledore’s Army led by Neville, Luna, Ginny,
, you guys are awesome!
  To the Order of the Phoenix,
 you were amazing especially you Mrs. Weasley! I’m so sorry for your losses but thank you, thank you so much.
  To the Hogwarts Professors led by Prof. Mc Gonagall
, you did an amazing job holding off Voldy! You were all brilliant!
  To the Malfoys,
uh I don’t know. How about I just stick my tongue out at the lot of you!
  To Dobby, 
 *wails* I can’t…just thank you so much. You’re the most loyal elf. The bravest free elf I know.
  To Kreacher,
 you poor thing. I had no idea what you had to go through and what made you the way you are. In the end, thank you for your bravery and for leading the elves to the battle.
  To the Death Eaters and Snatchers led by Bellatrix and Greyback
, I have two words foryou. “AVADA KEDAVRA!”
  To Umbridge,
 off to Azkaban, you go! 
  To Voldemort
, that’s right, I dare! I am completely with Harry, You don’t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?
  To the rest of the fallen,
 (view spoiler)[Professor Moody, Cedrick, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, James and Lily, Colleen Creevey and many others (hide spoiler)], like Neville said, your death was not in vain. Thank you! *wails*
  To the movie makers and actors
, thank you for bringing to life the characters we love. We will always look up to you people. Don't you dare disappoint us!^^
  To my Goodreads friends who bullied me into reading Harry Potter,
 thank you for destroying my life! I was doing perfectly fine without these books. You wrecked me pretty bad especially when I was reading the last book. I felt like hundreds of Dementors were surrounding me while reading it that I had to constantly cast a Patronus Charm while reading. It was really exhausting. My Patronus is a baby elephant, btw! Oh and I'm House Gryffindor, hurray! I'm afraid, I'm becoming worse than Luna Lovegood.
  To Jia and Kyra
, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, my young, smart and beautiful friends (March 06 is their actual birthday). You are both gifted for having such passion for reading at such young ages. Savor that gift and seize your most special day! <3","Mar 02, 2016"

  'Do not Pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love.'
it still feels weird to me me for finishing this series. I mean, I had read this series since August and I feel really ... weird. I feel like I just bought the first book yesterday instead of months ago. I feel like I just read the first book yesterday instead of months ago. Months ago, I thought I would feel okay when I finished this series but I do not feel that way. I feel ... like empty or hollow on the inside, you know what I mean, right? like there is this sad feeling and you just want to read it forever and ever but you can't because the story is over and there is nothing you can do. the only thing you can do is hugging the book because that way you would feel much better, like you actually hug the main characters.maybe this is how it feels like when you have to say goodbye to your best friends who have always be with you. no matter how difficult the situation is but they are there. I always envy those people who grew up with Harry Potter series. I envy them because they have such incredible childhood and me, I was a muggle that time and I used to hate reading novels so much and I had never once thought that I would love reading novels as much as I love breathing. Harry Potter series also has a great impact in my life. I was the kind of girl who always shy and never be myself because before reading HP I wanted people to like me, so I became what they wanted me to be and I rarely stood up for myself even when I knew I was right but Harry Potter series has changed me. you guys do know Luna, don't you? many people called her "" Loony "" because she believed in many things but Luna didn't care what they called her, she kept being herself and she had never ashamed to show her true self and that was the time I realized I was such a stupid girl who let my so-called friends changed me to be the girl I didn't even want me to be and now, my friends often say that I am such a weirdo or crazy girl who is very different from them because I love reading books so much and you know what? I just don't care about them anymore. I don't care when they say about me such a weirdo because I am not ashamed of being myself anymore because this is who I am and Luna also taught me one more thing, when you are being yourself and everyone teases you because of it. don't you ever worry about it because your true friends will come to you. these friends will accept who you are. Just like Luna who has amazing friends, Harry Ron, Ginny, Hermione and Neville.like I told you, I used to be very shy that I never stood up for even myself. few weeks ago, my friend who always insulted me, she insulted me again and no one in class was brave enough to stand up for themselves. the next thing I knew was that I snapped back at her and she was shocked and she has never insulted me again since that accident and she is kind of nice to me and we're friends now.This series has changed me to be a braver person. I don't think I can say this is a review because it's all about me and one more thing,,(view spoiler)[ I will never ever forget 2nd May 1998. I lost so many great friends Remus, Tonks, Colin, Fred, Sirius and many more. (hide spoiler)]I really want to say many thank you to Mrs. J. K. Rowling who wrote this awesome series because this series has changed me to be a better person and this series also changed me to be so much braver person. Thank you very much, Mrs. J. K. Rowling and thank you very much for reading this guys. ❤❤❤P.S. I found all these wonderful pictures on Google. Many thanks for the creators.","Nov 25, 2016"
"9780545010221","217197","Rion","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/217197-rion","***SPOILERS:From an interview with Rowling on the Today show:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19...Rowling said her original epilogue was “a lot more detailed,” including the name of every child born to the Weasley clan in the past 19 years. (Victoire, who was snogging Teddy — Lupin and Tonks’ son — is Bill and Fleur’s eldest.)Harry, Ron and HermioneWe know that Harry marries Ginny and has three kids, essentially, as Rowling explains, creating the family and the peace and calm he never had as a child.As for his occupation, Harry, along with Ron, is working at the Auror Department at the Ministry of Magic. After all these years, Harry is now the department head.“Harry and Ron utterly revolutionized the Auror Department,” Rowling said. “They are now the experts. It doesn’t matter how old they are or what else they’ve done.”Meanwhile, Hermione, Ron’s wife, is “pretty high up” in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, despite laughing at the idea of becoming a lawyer in “Deathly Hallows.”“I would imagine that her brainpower and her knowledge of how the Dark Arts operate would really give her a sound grounding,” Rowling said.Harry, Ron and Hermione don’t join the same Ministry of Magic they had been at odds with for years; they revolutionize it and the ministry evolves into a “really good place to be.”“They made a new world,” Rowling said.The wizarding naturalistLuna Lovegood, the eccentric Ravenclaw who was fascinated with Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and Umgubular Slashkilters, continues to march to the beat of her own drum.“I think that Luna is now traveling the world looking for various mad creatures,” Rowling said. “She’s a naturalist, whatever the wizarding equivalent of that is.”Luna comes to see the truth about her father, eventually acknowledging there are some creatures that don’t exist.“But I do think that she’s so open-minded and just an incredible person that she probably would be uncovering things that no one’s ever seen before,” Rowling said.Luna and Neville Longbottom?It’s possible Luna has also found love with another member of the D.A.When she was first asked about the possibility of Luna hooking up with Neville Longbottom several years ago, Rowling’s response was “Definitely not.” But as time passed and she watched her characters mature, Rowling started to “feel a bit of a pull” between the unlikely pair.Ultimately, Rowling left the question of their relationship open at the end of the book because doing otherwise “felt too neat.”Mr. and Mrs. Longbottom: “The damage is done.”There is no chance, however, that Neville’s parents, who were tortured into madness by Bellatrix Lestrange, ever left St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies.“I know people really wanted some hope for that, and I can quite see why because, in a way, what happens to Neville’s parents is even worse than what happened to Harry’s parents,” Rowling said. “The damage that is done, in some cases with very dark magic, is done permanently.”Rowling said Neville finds happiness in his grandmother’s acceptance of him as a gifted wizard and as the new herbology professor at Hogwarts.The fate of HogwartsNineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts, the school for witchcraft and wizardry is led by an entirely new headmaster (“McGonagall was really getting on a bit”) as well as a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. That position is now as safe as the other teaching posts at Hogwarts, since Voldemort’s death broke the jinx that kept a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from remaining for more than a year.While Rowling didn’t clarify whether Harry, Ron and Hermione ever return to school to finish their seventh year, she did say she could see Harry popping up every now and again to give the “odd talk” on Defense Against the D","Jul 24, 2007"

  I started the Harry Potter audio books at the end of August 2016. It took me a little over 4 months to listen to them all (I fit a few others in-between) but I’m so happy I finally finished. If you haven’t read them before, or you’re a long time fan looking for a re-read I can’t recommend the audio books enough. Jim Dale does a fantastic job with the narration. I can see myself going back one day and listening to them all over again! Now to the final book of the series: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book begins with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the run doing the task that Dumbledore gave Harry. To be honest, the first part of the book (and by first part, I mean the first 70-80% or so) was a little slow for me. There were exciting things to pop up here and there, but a lot of it was slow. Then the last few hours of the audiobook happened. I’ve gotta say, once this trio got back to Hogwarts, the ending was epic. There were moments of sorrow, moments that made me laugh, smile, cry… it was very emotional (view spoiler)[GAWD that Snape scene.… I can’t even! It made me cry like a baby. And love a character I didn’t care for much! (hide spoiler)]. I’m pleased with the way it ended. Overall, this series has been fantastic for me. I’m so glad I finally made the time to read them all. I’ve always loved the movies and been a fan, but now I feel like I need to go and re-watch everything! Harry Potter is a heartwarming series with courageous characters that I will hold near and dear to my heart.","Dec 19, 2016"

  “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.” 
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows literally touched the deepest part of my heart. This book has many layers and each one was refined by the smartest author I've ever known. J.K. Rowling always has a plan, she never threw anything into her books without thinking it first. In this case, I think she planned the ending of this book since she started writing for sure, and every point she emphasized in HP 7 was unfaltering and made me believe that it's a pure diamond when she ended her story with an epic score.
  “Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?” 
Harry, Ron and Hermione prove themselves that they're just ordinary humans. They bicker. They argue each other. They make the sly plan. Importantly, they get to know how to forgive and forget, that's all that matters.
  “We're all human, aren't we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.”
This book is EVERYTHING. It became much more than just a fiction for me. It had its voice and when it whispered in my ears, I literally believed that there was magic in this world. Each chapter made me strong and wanted to be someone better. Each character epitomized a different kind of person. This book doesn't deserve five stars review, it's beyond measure and a thousand stars are not even enough.
  Albus Severus,"" Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, ""you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.”

"9780545010221","7577","pinkgal","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7577-pinkgal","It was September 1998; the third Harry Potter book had just been released. Pottermania? What's that? It was still unknown except to a vast population of younglings who'd read it... and I fell in love. Oh, how I fell in love. I fell in love with the poor, starved-for-affection, later known to be a twit Harry. I fell in love with the pretentious know-it-all Hermione. I fell in love with the awkward, grew-up-in-his-brother's-shadows Ron... and most of all? I fell in love with the snarky, unplatable, snarling, rude, hygienically-disinclined professor of potions, Severus Snape.Almost ten years later, I'm still obsessed with it in many ways. This is the Seventh Book. This is the end of Harry Potter. I cried, I wept, I laughed, sometimes quite hysterically. And overall? I loved it. I loved Ron's humour, Harry's angst, Hermione's smarts, Snape's devotion, Dumbledore's love, Percy's return, Dobby's sacrifice, the change of Kreacher, absolutely everything. I kept waiting and waiting to be disappointed and yes, I was disappointed on the occasion, but the thrill far outweighed the flaws. As for Snape? One of the characters I fell absolutely in love with? THIS IS A HUGE SPOILER.Snape..................Snape dies. He dies working for Dumbledore. He dies, looking into Harry's eyes. He dies because for the last thirty years of his life, he has loved Lily Evans and everything he has done and everything he sacrificed was for her. His death provoked a number of emotions in me and one of the major ones was utter, utter grief. He's been abused and used his whole life, whether by his parents, by his classmates, by Voldemort, by Dumbledore, and I felt such freaking anger that in the end, he wasn't even given the proper funeral that he totally deserved. In the book itself, it made sense, because whatever Snape did for the Greater Good, he was still a bastard. But as a reader, my heart broke into ittybitty pieces over him. There were tons of other things going on at the same time. I say, Rowling is an excellent action scene writer. I'm terrible at writing action that's vivid and engaging, but she managed to do it. Harry himself lives. But he's been forever scarred by his experience. And that, actually, is one of the best parts of his book. He was such an arse in books 5 and 6, and to have this mature young man emerge was one of the greatest joys in this series. I was so, so, so happy that he got the happiness he wanted. The ending was much WTF? for me, since it was like a SOOPER HAPPILY EVER AFTER ending, but at the same time... Harry is finally happy and that means a great deal to me. Well. Harry, I've been a fan for almost ten years and in those ten years, you've made me laugh, cry, scream, whoop, run around, obsess, tender, hard, awesome and about a million other things. I've watched you grow from a scared, unsure first year into a hopeful young man in the third and fourth, an angsty teen in the fifth and sixth, and in the seventh? You came full circle and you were as your parents were. Happy, with children of your own. You changed so much and it felt like I had grown up partly with you, though I was but fourteen years old when I read you. I love all of the characters, I love all the books, and well? R.I.P. Severus Snape. You'll be missed. Same with you, Fred, Dobby, Lupin, Tonks, Moody, Colin, Scrimgoeur, Bellatrix, Peter, yes, even Voldemort. A lifetime has passed and HP is going to be one of those books that'll stay with me forever. So... peace out, Harry! You deserve out!","Jul 22, 2007"

    Book Review
  
 4+ out of 5 stars to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and supposedly final book in 2007 by J.K. Rowling. But then ""Cursed Child"" came out last year... so is a series really over? Not in our hearts and minds, my friends... neither shall this one be... and although I considered spending a huge part of today drafting a very thorough review of Harry Potter, my instincts kicked in and told me not to do so... instead, let's meet up and talk about it somewhere if you want to get into the details. I literally don't have the ability to write everything I am thinking about when it comes to these books... and I wrote my first novel in less than 3 months with not a stitch of writer's block.Sometimes things just flow out of your creativity and into the world's waiting and willing hands. And that's exactly what's happened with the HP book series. It's the kind of book where you can read it at any age and feel a deep connection. You can re-read it and watch the movie all in the same day and never be bored or feel the need to do anything else. When HP movies are running on TV back-to-back over a weekend, I always catch a few of them.These characters are wonderful. The plot is just brilliant. And in this last book, when all the surprises burst from within our own little goblet of fire, we find true nirvana in a set of books unlike any other. From drama to shock, sadness to beauty, Deathly Hallows re-invents the construct of an emotional roller-coaster. Whether you read the whole series or just picked up the last one, you feel the power inside the text... especially when you consider it all started with an innocent and scared little boy who lived under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive.We are all Harry Potter at one point in our lives or during the course of his life. Could be when you were a child searching for someone to love you, or it may be now as an adult looking back on the differences you faced in the eyes of good versus evil. Whatever the connection is, you'll feel it until you are no more... and while this may seem like an exaggeration or a rather ethereal point of view... one thing I know is true:We all make the exact same face when we hear or think of anything to do with his amazing story: there's a brief pause, our lips curl, our eyes roll back a little as we shut out lids, our breath thins out towards the back of our throat, and our hearts all decide it's OK to stop beating for just that 1 second. And in our collective sigh of ""I love Harry Potter"" exclamations, we are all for once, connected by a shared intense feeling that might be strong enough to fuel the world's future.

This series had everything which I needed for my favourite series. And it is needless to say that now this series holds 1st position in my list. I haven't read a series/book which explains literally everything. Imaginative to be exact.  OVERVIEW Now harry wants to destroy all the Horcruxes to kill Voldemort completely.  RANDOM THOUGHTS=> It was a big shock for me that Harry was also one the horcruxes. And this fact was also mouth-dropping that Dumbledore was preparing Harry for death by the hands of Voldemort. Umm... it's understandable. It has to be done to kill the Voldemort completely. But I didn't feel good. It was good that Harry didn't die. And Mrs. Rowling handled this fact reasonably.=> The Tale of Three Brothers was interesting.=> Action scenes were pretty vivid. I still remember them.=> I was expecting that Nagini would be killed by Harry but not. It's okay by the way.=> Epilogue seemed to me J. K. Rowling had in mind that sometime later she would again start this series.
   BEST BOOK OF THE SERIES
I enjoyed them almost equally. There is very, very minor difference in my liking:1. Prisoner of Azkaban2. Goblet of Fire3. Deathly Hallows4. Half-Blood Prince5. Chamber of Secrets6. Sorcerer's Stone7. Order of PhoenixI just wanted to do this. But in short I adore every book of this series.So that's it! I have finished this series. I am happy. For now I don't have plans, at all, to re-read books because I think there is a very little time and there are sooo many books I want to read very much. But IF I ever will plan to re-read books, then this series, for sure, and Artemis Fowl series will be the one which I will choose to read.Both are unique in their own accord. I wanted to do the comparison but it's useless. I always end up liking both equally. 1st position is given to HP because of J. K.

"9780545010221","103544","Sammy","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/103544-sammy","Was this book so awesome because it finally addressed all those long unanswered questions?  Yes.  Was this book just fantastic because we finally know what happens to everyone?  Yes.  Was this book wonderful because Rowling was ruthless and took no prisoners?  Yes.  Was this book splendid because we knew all the characters and cared about them like they were real?  Yes.  Was this book so great because it made you laugh, cry, gasp, emote out loud?  Yes.  That was one of my favorite things about the book.  Regardless of where I was, whether it be sitting on the couch next to my roommate, alone in my room, or standing in my shop, I found myself cheering and gasping and all other sorts of reactions, I was just that into the story.The most emotional part for me, one of them at least, was when Dobby died.  I don't know what it was about that, but I was sobbing and had tears streaming down my face.  When they describe putting the socks on his feet, that was the part that opened the floodgates.  I am one of those people that supports the theory that socks are a very imporant symbol in the Harry Potter series.  I even did a report in one of my high school English classes on it.  ""Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed upon the elf's bare feet.  Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby's head, muffling his batlike ears.""  Rowling, master of subtle detail, still includes that brief mention of socks.  It was that which really did me in.Another thing that impressed me was how well the story flowed.  Probably a combination of being a good writer and knowing, without a doubt, where the story was going and what she wanted to have happen allowed Rowling to keep the story smooth and not jerky.  So easily, especially in the beginning/middle chapters in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's search for Horcruxes things could have become so choppy.  And while time did pass quickly in brief sections it still flowed.  A lot of writers, even good writers, can't seem to make something like that work, yet Rowling did, proving herself yet again.I was also really impressed by her ballsy moves of killing off several main characters, especially right in the beginning.  I thought it was going to be in the big final battle ('cause c'mon, you knew it was coming) that we lost all our favorites, not within the first few chapters.  RIP Hedwig and Mad-Eye.  That was one major way you got sucked in because you're thinking, ""Oh my God!  Characters I love are already dying!  What the-"" and then you keep going because you need to know if anyone else is going to kick it.  For some reason though Rowling just loves killing off my favorite characters, Dumbledore, Moody, Fred (and George too in a way), Lupin, Tonks.  I was especially angry over the Lupin/Tonks death.  It felt like a sort of snub because, yay they're married!  Yay, they're having a baby!  Yay, he's a little metamorphmagus.  Boo, both parents are suddenly dead.  Rude.  But I guess it made the whole thing hurt a lot more, and it did.Honestly, I felt Rowling tied things up beautifully and not in that harried, ""Oh yeah about that?  Um... this happens!  Yeah, that's it!""  I think many fans feel vindicated (i.e. the Snape/Lily shippers, those who thought Harry was a Horcrux, don't mess with Mrs. Weasley) after reading this book.  Of course there are probably some who are broken down and upset that what they thought was going to happen didn't.  In the end we all got one hell of a story and went on one fantastic adventure.  No matter what happened, no matter who died or who ended up with who this book was more than I could have hoped for, I was not disappointed at all.All I can say now is: Jo, thank you.","Jun 20, 2007"

I bought it at a midnight release party, devoured it, and knew that I loved it.But now that I've spent the last couple of weeks reading it aloud to my son, I understand why I loved it so much. Does anyone fully appreciate the scope of what Rowling did with this book? She spent years upon years, and six other books building a world and populating it with characters, and then she BROUGHT IT AND THEM ALL TOGETHER. Spells, tools, people, events, that had been sprinkled throughout the other six books were now smoothly woven together into this last great battle. And yes, they spend a lot of time camping, but as Harry says to Ron, ""Did you think we'd be finding a Horcrux a day?"" No, I didn't, or at least I hoped that they wouldn't, because that would have been too pat, too unrealistic. Instead, they had to search, they had to learn, they had to struggle, and be bored, and be lost, and then find what they needed. The Ron-Harry-Hermione friendship is tested, and found to be unbreakable. Ron and Hermione's relationship moves forward, Harry has time to reflect on his life, the people who have helped him, what his future might hold.And I loved it. I loved the moments of solemn reflection. I loved the testing of loyalties, revelations about the youth of Dumbledore and Snape (and if you don't bawl like a baby reading about Snape's memories, YOU HAVE NO SOUL!), Lily and even Petunia. There are no throwaway characters in Rowling's world, yet it isn't just some endless catalogue of: And Dean did this, and Neville did this . . . Everything is part of one whole, beautiful story. The Weasleys continue to show their strength and love for Harry (and if you don't cry when Percy shows up, or when Fred . . . you know . . . YOU HAVE NO SOUL!), Neville proves that he is his parents' son, and a true Gryffindor . . . and in short, there are so many stand up and cheer moments that I couldn't sit still while I was reading it. Of course, there are many, many tragedies, but after each tragedy, a moment of triumph to balance it, for which I say:Thank you, J. K. Rowling, for creating one of the best, most magical series for children of all time. Thank you for giving us Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred and George, Ginny and Luna, and so many wonderful moments.And thank you, most of all, for not screwing up the grand finale.Best. Series ender.

This ripped me apart, then put me back together, then ripped me apart all over again. If this is not a good finale, then I do not, and will never know, what is. This brought it all. Every quality deemed to each Hogwarts house, bravery, skill, cunning, ambition, knowledge, wit, honesty, equality, plus action and adventure, were prominent throughout the entire book. J.K. Rowling is a master and brings in real world issues into her fantastical one. I cried, I laughed, I screamed, I smiled, and when it was all over I just sat there and contemplated what my life will be like now that I have finished the series once more. I highly recommend this series more than anything else in the world to those who need some magic in their lives, which is virtually everyone. Love conquers all, and without delving too much into spoilers, that is where I will leave this. Please pick up this series if you have not, I promise it will not disappoint.This next portion is a little bit into my history with Harry Potter, to better understand how I come up with my thoughts about this series. The first time I read the Harry Potter series I was 13 years old. Now, that may seem a bit older than most when they started reading this miraculous series, but I was skeptical to the power that these books had on so many. Although I was older than most when I first read this series, I was also still pretty young and could really only relate to Harry and the others up to about the third book, Prisoner of Azkaban, when they were 13, like I was. Now, exactly five years later, I have been every age (other than in '19 Years Later'), that Harry, Hermione, and Ron have been throughout the entire series, which I think benefits me greatly in understanding their thoughts, feelings, and decisions in each book. When I first read the books, I knew that I could never love anything more, and now, five years later, I am even more sure that this series will not only stay with me forever, bring me light in my darkest days, and be passed on to my children, but also that I have not felt this way about anything. It might seem silly, but I think when one finds this in something, they know, whether or not others will understand. I will most certainly be rereading this series in the future many more times and will continue to be astounded with the growth that I see in myself as I get older, but also with this series, because as I change, it changes with me. It would be a dishonour to give this anything less than 5 stars! Infinity out of 5!","Mar 21, 2016"

I was VERY disappointed with the last portion of the book. But the criticisms are for later.I've always thought that JK's writing was admirable if a little underdeveloped, but the paragraphs just don't seem to flow together as well as they used to.They finally leave school. I never thought they would, but it sure as hell was an exciting notion. However the lack of supporting characters (that you might find at Hogwarts) means that this book is darker and the lack of humour makes for a depressing hundred pages around pg200.The deaths... a little weird how the human deaths are less effective, maybe that's just me but Hedwig and Dobby's deaths broke my heart. With mad-eye... well, he was an asshole so i didn't care. With Fred... well, there is another one so the impact is lessened. With Lupintonks... well if they were stupid enough to name Harry godfather (even THEY should have seen the parellalism!) then they deserve to die. No i don't mean that, but as we didn't see them die it seems less horrifying.So much more interesting and original than the others this daring new direction led to some bad writing which didn't go anywhere in the end (wtf was the hallows about?).The Hallows was a ridiculous idea and frankly i was horrified that Rowling was attempting to introduce such a 'major' theme in the last book with only one brief reference in book six. They were pointless, in the end what did it matter who had ownership of the elder wand? no one used it in 'the final duel' anyway.I no longer like Dumbledore, JK dragged him through the mud and didn't thoroughly wash him off. Harry forgave him but i sure as hell didn't (and who didn't see the 'Harry is a Horcrux' thing coming?The chapter 'King's cross' made me cry. But not because it was well written, rather the opposite, it didn't make sense at times (where the hell were they?) i had to reread the section on harry's 'phoenixlike' ability several times and i still hate it. It was so weak. This sequence was nothing like the other 'endofbookharryanddumbledore' explanations we have come to know and love. Nothing was explained in this chapter everything was re-explained and slightly embellished. The chapters immediately preceding this were the real treat of the book, Snape is finally redeemed (although after ten years of waiting i did expect a better ironclad reason for trusting him than loving lily). Harry facing his mortality is heartbreaking even though most of us have imagined it countless times. The moment right before his death is about as perfect an HP moment there is. He should have stayed dead and the narration flick to another.Voldemort's Invincible Army is defeated too easily and Bellatrix's death is unsatisfying as Molly has no real motive for revenge (nono Fred's death doesn't count). Harry should have done it. He also should have performed at least one killing curse in the book, he performed the other unforgivables, so why not?Voldemort is killed by a reflecting spell.What?WHAT?Are you KIDDING me?Could it possibly be more anticlimactic?What was the point of the elder wand then? Why the elaborate buildup when Harry doesn't even perform the execution?Anyone could have duelled to a reflection, and since when can that happen?A true HP fan must take alot on faith to enjoy this ending.The less said about the epilogue the better. Probably been written since book one and it shows. There is no depth, any hp fan could guess (or assume) this ending, its not even worth reading. Albus Severus was the only icing on this unsatisfying and dry cake.If you do read this book close it at the end of 'the forest again' and write your own ending.OR wait for JK to realise her mistake and re publish with an alternate ending.This was not a rant.Update: Look. I gave it four stars okay?","Aug 05, 2007"

I can step back from the hoopla and step back from the movies and really get into all the Grindelwald passages and connect the dots with Dumbledore. Best friends, no? One creates the wizarding war and sends his wizard troops out to conquer based on a young Dumbledore's words, only to end in a duel that leaves Dumbledore with the Elder Wand that was in his friend's hands for so many years. Of course, we get to skip the first one that ended in the death of Dumbledore's sister, but who knows, we will probably be seeing no only Dumbledore but perhaps some Pensives. :)Such delicious stories to pick up soon with the sequels to Fantastic Beasts, no? Especially since we get such a nice close-up of our favorite villain!Just what is the connection between the Obscurials and the Deatheaters, anyway? Oddly suspicious, no? And Ariana Dumbledore?

A lot. It helps to have EXPLANATIONS over the movies, no matter how pretty all the action scenes are. :) It sounds like a recurring theme, no? Well, there are things that books do so much better than any other medium, and when it comes to UNDERSTANDING, it's peerless.I didn't nearly get so annoyed at the absolutely nothing happening sections in the tale, either, unlike in the movie, because I was actually invested in all those little side characters this time. I wanted to know what was on the radio. It's kinda odd, no?

He also took special interest in killing Harry Potter whose main mission for the book would be not to die long enough to fulfill the mission given to him by Dumbledore in the previous book, thus no Hogwarts studies this time; it is about stayin' alive for Harry:Something I noticed again during my reread of the series, especially this book: J.K. Rowling is not at all shy about killing her characters, especially good ones. George R.R. Martin often gets all the slack for doing thisbut despite Harry Potter's author saying that she feels bad about killing good people, a great number of them died in the series (and outside it if you start counting from Harry's parents). Some of these deaths are still as tragic on the second time around. Harry's gradual discovery of Dumbledore as not-quite-good-guy is brilliant. It took me two reads to grasp all the nuances of this. Now for the bad parts which unfortunately made me reduce otherwise perfect rating by one star. Ron - to use his favorite word - is a git, especially in this book. He was destined to remain forever in Harry's shadow, but this is exactly the place he deserved. He did not do anything exciting on his own since fated chess match in the first (!) book. As a character Ginny Weasley cannot be even compared to Luna Lovegood, not to mention Hermione Granger. If Harry could not get Hermione, I hoped he ended up with Luna - sure she is loony at times, but she is always understanding, brave, and smart; read carefully her parts if you do not believe me. She was able to help Harry more than Ginny whose only help was kissing him a couple of times. The forest sequence of the book was way too long. This is probably the only part of the series which felt drown out. The whole epilogue feels off. I understand the need to show happily ever afterbut it still feels out of place. So as I mentioned with these complaints I have to reduce the rating by one, reluctantly. The whole series however deserved unconditional perfect rating. If you have not read it because you think this is for children or because it is too mainstream, or because you think it offends your religious beliefs - get off your high horseand head to your nearest library for the magical experience.","Jul 31, 2012"

  “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”
The last stand. Holy shit, this was definitely one of the best books I've ever read. It was interesting to the core and never bored me for even a second. This was through and through a pain in the ass. It pained me to read the last chapter, the last book. I didn't want this to end. Still don't want to.(view spoiler)[Fred, Dora, Lupin... Snape...  (hide spoiler)]Why is Mrs. Rowling so keen on killing? Holy shit, she's turned this into heart-break. My heart shatters every time someone dies, I'm emotional and a cry-baby just like that.There were moments in the book when it reminded me how fun it all used to be. No matter how morbid it all becomes, Mrs. Rowling always manages to keep some things intact, like the humor. The humor is definitely reduced but not non-existent.I laughed so hard when Molly Weasley screamed ""NOT MY DAUGHTER YOU BITCH!"" at Bellatrix (view spoiler)[and then killed her.  (hide spoiler)] How can you not love Mum Weasley? She is mama bear. She'd protect her cubs at all costs.The Epilogue is such an emotional thing. It wrecks your soul and then it puts it all back together... James. Albus Severus. Lily. Hugo. Rose.I was crying because it just occurred to me that Harry, Ron and Hermione were like 11 in the first book and ended up having kids and being in their late 30's which at this point I had lost my shit and crying and did not know what to do with myself.
  “Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?”
I just want to say that Harry Potter taught me to be brave and love rather than hate and not being afraid of even dying for those I love. Harry chose to be the better man and he defeated Voldemort not with power but with bravery and courage that only love can armor you with. He fought with friends by his side.

I want to see how they compare - what thoughts/reactions etc. had changed, if any, and any additional insights - but it does make me nervous, because I reckon my first review will prove to be much better written - and what if I seem dumber this time around? I find I get a bit muddled from watching the films, too, in that after watching them I can't remember if bits were in the book or the film and vice versa. Oh well. Really must stop over-thinking things! [Scroll down for my first review, from 2007.]The final Harry Potter book always looks too short to me, like, how could everything possibly be wrapped up in a book that's not as long as The Order of the Phoenix, when there's still so much to do?! I felt that the first time, and I felt that again. But once again I admire Rowling's skill in crafting a tremendous story and a powerful ending for what is to me one of the best fantasy series out there. There's a lot going on in this novel, but it's nicely balanced with quieter, slower parts and you really get that last chance to really know Harry, Ron and Hermione. Rowling never lets plot overpower her characters or her story, and she won't be rushed: the pacing is steady and consistent throughout, which only adds to the tension-filled scenes where you start biting your nails.This is a book that makes me cry, and I'll tell you why - in a bit. I wondered how I could share all the things I love about this particular book, and figured listing them was probably the best option.  Hedwig dying. I had completely forgotten, and it's so, so sad. I like how they did it for the movie, giving her a role and using her as a visual means of identifying Harry, since in the book it's more complicated. 
   Hermione erasing her existence - removing knowledge and memory of herself from her parents' minds and sending them off to Australia under new identities so that they aren't a target. There is something incredibly tragic about this, though it doesn't get much attention. I can't imagine the kind of strength and resolve it would take to do that, though the realities of the world would probably help give you the resolve. 
   Kreacher becoming an ally. And all for an act of genuine kindness (Harry gives him ""Master Regulus'"" locket after hearing his story). And what he was made to do for Voldemort. Nothing, not even Kreacher, is black and white, and that's an important lesson to learn. He betrayed Sirius at the end of The Order of the Phoenix, but when you learn more about him, you realise it's not a simple matter at all. 
   Dobby's death. He was such a brave, selfless elf, and as characters, he and Kreacher really brought into sharp relief the whole issue of house elves and their mistreatment. 
   The mortality of the Weasley's. Until this book, they always struck me as one of those solid features who come close to utter tragedy but always manage to avoid it, like with Arthur getting attacked by the snake. Here, though, George loses an ear and, at the end, Fred is killed. Fred's death is one of the saddest things for me.  
   Likewise, Lupin and Tonks' deaths at the final battle - I remember reading that the first time and feeling that sense of utter disbelief. I felt it again here, like someone had surely made a mistake, especially when Harry sees their bodies next to Fred and their described as sleeping. But with a newborn left behind, and the fact that Lupin only recently found the first real happiness he's ever known - to have that cut short, it makes me want to cry just typing this. The deaths of these characters had a much bigger impact on me than the death of Dumbledore - as big a surprise as that was on first reading - at the end of The Half-Blood Prince. In a way, Dumbledore had to go so that Harry could come into his own. But these characters, their deaths are so needless, and they were too young and left too much behind. 
   Snape's love for Lily. I knew there was a good reason why we forgave Snape at the end, but I was glad I couldn't remember exactly what it was. Snape is another complex character, who shows that it's not a simple matter of right or wrong, good or evil. He's not someone to be judged at face value or first impressions, though obviously that's what everyone has been doing all his life. It's not even pity that I felt for him, but empathy at losing the woman he loved and sacrificing everything in memory of her. He never stopped loving her. Timeless love. No wonder Dumbledore trusted him implicitly: he understood the power of such emotions and never dismissed them as insignificant. 
   The truth about Dumbledore's past, and his sister Ariana. So sad. I haven't seen the second half of the movie version yet but I hope they include these details. 
   Harry walking to his impending death, supported by the ghosts of his parents, Sirius and Lupin. I cried when James and Lily and Cedric appeared at the end of The Goblet of Fire, and they had no less power here, bolstering their son and being there so he wasn't alone as he went to Voldemort, knowing he was going to be killed - and not knowing that he would survive it.  
   The dragon kept imprisoned in Gringott's Bank. I felt so bad for the poor tortured beast, and so happy when they freed it. 
   Xenophilius Lovegood. The position he was in, having his daughter taken away and used as a threat against him, to betray his beliefs (i.e., in Harry as the Chosen One). 
   Petunia Dursley, Harry's aunt, is a sad figure in her own right. It becomes clear in this book why she was so anti-magic: she was jealous of her sister Lily's ability. The scene where Lily mentions that Petunia wrote to Dumbledore, asking to be let into Hogwarts, and Petunia's feelings of embarrassment and shame and longing, of feeling excluded - you can't help but feel for the little girl who grew into a resentful woman in denial. 
   There's lots of happy things here too, like Fleur and Bill Weasley's wedding and Ron and Hermione finally getting together, as well as great mini-adventures that all lead up to the final show-down. The plan to get into the Ministry of Magic, and later the Gringott's Bank break-in, for example, were really fun and exciting and scary. And one of my favourite scenes is the Neville Longbottom snake-killing scene - really, I just love all the Neville scenes but that one in particular really stuck in my head all the intervening years since first reading it.And underlying it all is this Hitler-like race and class war that Voldemort is enacting. Muggles and Mud-bloods become demonised and terrorised and everyone has to prove their ""purity"". The film captured this really well in the set design, especially inside the Ministry.I loved that there was so much I couldn't remember when I started this book - I couldn't remember what the Hallows were, or what was inside the Snitch, or how they found the other Horcruxes. I had forgotten Dobby died until I watched the film a few months ago. It was wonderful to read it almost like it was the first time.And then there's the epilogue - I'll mention it because I remember how much fans railed against it when the book first came out. I'm still not sure why, except maybe it wasn't up to the standards of the rest of the series. I read somewhere that Rowling wrote it at the beginning, which is kinda cool, and shows just how well she planned it all out. The line that I love is this one, where Harry tells his son: ""Albus Severus, [...] you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew."" [p.607] It gets me every time.2007 REVIEW - 1ST READINGSo, there were huge expectations - and quite a few bets, debates and demands - for this last book, and personally I thought it was a great ending to the series. One of the things that I love about these books, that has always impressed me, is how tightly plotted they are, how detailed. Others have complained about the plotholes in Deathly Hallows, but I didn't see any. Granted, I wasn't looking for them, and I didn't succeed in my intention to re-read the previous books before this one (managed Philosopher's Stone but left it too late for the others) so I had forgotten some details. Deathly Hallows made me laugh, made me cry (seriously, I bawled - and there were no tissues at the cottage so had to mop my face with paper towel...), had me pressing my knuckles to my mouth (the closest I come to biting my nails), and kept me on the edge of my seat. What more could you ask for? Quite a few characters die in this book, but everyone knew there would be some deaths because Rowling said there would be. She's also said, apparently, that the books are about death, though, having read the last book, I understand now that she doesn't mean they're about death, but about death. The whole idea behind The Boy Who Lived was that his mother's sacrifice protected him from the killing curse, and when Harry in turn sacrifices himself, he protects everyone at Hogwarts (where all the characters assemble for the big show-down) from Lord Voldemort. I also liked how the death of Dumbledore (in the previous book) and Snape's betrayal are resolved; I liked that Snape did it all for love of Lily, Harry's mother. It worked, brought out the humanity that has always lurked deep beneath Snape's corrosive veneer. The saddest deaths were of Fred, one of the Weasley twins, and Lupin and Tonks, only weeks after the birth of their baby. Is it any wonder that I cried? And even though there was always the hope that Harry would survive, still the section leading up to his sacrifice was written so convincingly, so non-melodrammatically, that I actually had to put the book down for a minute and do a quick turn about the house to calm myself down a bit. The only bit that looked like a glaring plothole at first was when Neville pulls the sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat to lop Voldemort's snake's head off with. That confused me - last we saw of the sword, the goblin had taken it and disappeared into the depths of Gringotts with it. Then I remembered: Harry had pulled the sword out of the Sorting Hat in the Chamber of Secrets, too. The last lingering doubt is why the hat was on fire and why exactly Voldemort wanted to non-sort them then and there. Ah well, it works for dramatic effect! Another part of the book which has received a lot of flak: the epilogue. Saccharine, it's been described. I have to agree, and it's the only bit of saccharine in the entire series. Apparently it was written way back in the 90s, but I don't think that excuses it. It was like icing on the cake - sickly sweet, not at all filling or satisfying, hiding the cake beneath which is what you really want to eat, as long as you can have the icing too. So we learn how they paired up and what their kids' names are, that Neville is a Herbology professor and, well, very little else. Noticeably, Harry's conversation with Dumbledore in King's Cross Station shows how much Harry has grown and matured. He's moved through his teenage angst and become reliable, responsible, thoughtful, more patient. By not going after the Deathly Hallows, his first impulse is tempered by a new, cooler head. Aside from the humour, reminiscent of Roald Dahl, and the plotting, the character development of Harry is another reason why the books are so enjoyable, and long-lasting.","Nov 07, 2007"

  Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love
 This is my favourite Harry Potter book, I adore it, I love it so much. It's weird because it's not /usual/ Harry Potter. It doesn't have much Hogwarts, there's no quidditch -- but I love it I don't wanna get gushy about Harry Potter I mean you all feel me on this everyone loves Harry Potter, you get me. I'm just gonna list some reasons I love this book, this series, so much. - The characters.  I just want it to be on the record Harry James Potter is one of my top five favourite characters. He is just SUCH A GOOD PERSON. I admire his bravery, his selflessness and his determination ( and also he's literally the most savage person his roasts are life ) I love so much about him - I love that he's not perfect either. He can be mean, arrogant, literally annoying asf but I LOVE HIM. He makes me so emotional, like he actually breaks my heart. Thats why this book is actual crack for me. There is so much of it relating to Harry's parents, his past, his childhood. There is so much about him having to do the right thing even though it's hard, even though he's suffering, even though people have literally been fucking with him for years he does the right thing anyway I JUST LOVE HIM ALOT Other characters, Ron man. Ron. He fucks up bad but he comes back and he redeems himself and urggh I love him. His loyalty is amazing, but he's such a real character. I love how he (quite literally) is able to conquer (stab with a sword) his demons and his character development is amazing and he's just so funny and such a good friend he's my son ?? I love him. HERMIONE I honestly can't say anything except wife me she's so inspirational and passionate and sticks to her beliefs even when they're unpopular and I honestly just love her and the trio so much ?Deathly Hallows is just so good like lets recap on some highlights.  --> Opens on Dudley actually accepting Harry and thanking him --> Wild broom chase, crazy sky wand fights and I'm Holey Fred ... get it ? --> Ron fighting his mother about the wedding. Harry and Ginny. Horcrux planning.  --> Coffee shop death eater skirmish --> REGULUS ARCTURUS BLACK --> Lily's letter --> KREACHER --> Ministry break-in. Harry sticking it to Umbridge --> Potterwatch --> GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN ?!?! --> The DA resisting in Hogwarts, magical graffiti that says Dumbledore's Army, Still Recruiting! --> Speaking of Dumbledore, just the entirely of his and Aberforths family story --> Godrics Hollow. Harry seeing James & Lily's graves and the house. Heartbreaking but beautiful --> THE BIT WHEN NEVILLE WIPES OUT NAGINI --> Snape's story --> Everything coming together so beautifully at the end aND THE GRAND HALL SCENE --> Harry mending the Phoenix wand  --> Teddy Lupin existing --> Harry getting to see his parents/Sirius/Lupin say what he's always wanted to crying bye --> like the whole book tbh ?? I love it ??I could say alot about the beautiful messages and sybolism. I could say about the beautiful and poignant way Harry's grief and loss about his parents is dealt with, or talk about the perfect symbolism of Voldermort's death - and how it shows that he was not special but just a regular man who was devoid of love and took his quest for power way too far. I could talk about how Voldermort's soul is represented and what Voldermort represents for humanity but I wouldn't be the first and I won't be the last and I would have too much to say anyway (and no way to say it how I wanna)So instead I'll just say I adore this book, forever and always. I adore this series and everything it gave me. I love that it created such a wonderful and expansive world I wanna live in. I love that it gave me characters who were my friends growing up. I love that it's defined my childhood and become to important to me and I can't believe it came out nearly ten years ago. I love it so much, forever.","Feb 08, 2016"

And they barely get away. How many times did that happen? At the wedding, at the cafe, in the woods, at the Malfoys, at Gringotts, at the Ministry, at Godric's Hallow ... ... ... at Luna's dad's house ... ... did I miss any??? I mean, after one such incident, there's a line that says something like, How they managed to escape from such a situation was beyond him ... yeah, that's because it's a freakin' novel.3. What the fuck was up with that chapter with Dumbledore? It's like JK Rowling was trying too hard to make this book more than the good story it should have been.4. Draco was ignored, explained away as a just a contrived plot point.5. Ron leaving and then coming back to save Harry - contrived plot point.6. Ron and Hermione finally kissing ... in the middle of a war ... in the middle of a hallway that's about to fall apart ... ... sure, that's going to happen.7. Who the fuck cares about the characters that did die? I mean, only the Weasely twin was someone important.8. And of course Hedwig died. Harry couldn't have a way to communicate with the Wizarding world now could he.9. Lord Voldemort has been foiled by Harry how many times now? And when he ""kills"" Harry, don't you think that a wizard mastermind who's been foiled by this stupid boy as many times as he had, would go make sure the little prat is dead himself? Like he'd go poke him with his wand or something?10. Hermione, in every other book, has had some sort of thing that only she can figure out, but in this book she suddenly becomes this little wussy girl that lets Harry walk all over her.--It took me FOUR days to read this book. FOUR!!! I - little miss read the HP books in ten hours straight - put this book down volutarily for three nights in a row.

Rowling could wrap up all the unresolved issues and contradictions with her final book. The friends have no idea where to start hunting for horcruxes. Where are they? WHAT are they? And when they figure those things out, how do they destroy them? Dumbledore is gone, so he can’t help. And what the fuck is up with Snape? I am happy to say that, despite my doubts, Rowling did a wonderful job of resolving everything, all the while changing everything I thought to be true. In the first three chapters alone, so much change has happened. Dumbledore is gone, and Harry can’t reconcile the man he thought he knew with all the accusations and doubts flying around. The Malfoys are no longer powerful but instead are being humiliated by their fellow death eaters and by Voldemort. And instead of Harry leaving the Dursleys’ at the end of the summer like always, the Dursleys are running for cover. Even Dudley behaves completely out of character and is nice to and concerned about Harry. What is the world coming to? Voldemort’s return has changed virtually everything.Throughout the book, we get one mind blowing reveal after another which caused me to flip back through previous books and grin at the brilliance of a series that was fully planned from start to finish before book one was ever written. And the changes kept coming. I saw them everywhere: in the behavior of the Ministry, in the loss of characters we adored, and in the revelation of characters we hoped for but were unsure of (I’m looking at you Ron, Dumbledore, Neville, Percy, and Snape). And although I hate to admit it, because I have ignored on principle that the epilogue even exists for many years, I saw them there, too. The orphan boy with no one to love him from the first book is part of a wonderful family he has always wanted, with his trusted friends by his side. What a fantastic way to end this groundbreaking series. Except for his kid’s name. I mean, come on.","Mar 05, 2016"

"9780545010221","76346","Eleanor","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76346-eleanor","(shamelessly cross-posted from my livejournal entry) Spoilers below!I remember picking up Harry Potter around the time that book 3 had come out. There had been buzz about the books in the post with a picture of JK standing by railroad tracks and some inside joke about ""muggles."" I probably wouldn't have read them had I not babysat for my nextdoor neighbor's kids who were 7 and 10 at the time, and asked me to read it to them as a bedtime story. What is so compelling about these children's books? The well-woven archetypes, the mystery, the imaginative combination of fantasy and fancy? As another blogger put it, the books are overflowing with story. Never once are they a method for JK to assuage her vanity as a writer, because the writing itself isn't deep, their success is a result of Rowling being an increadibly steady storyteller whose approach has more than a few similarities to classic storytelling. Her main three characters account for the three things Aristotle named as the only necessary ingredients in successful rhetoric - Ethos (Harry) Pathos (Ron) and Logos (Hermione). She extends this to all aspects of the Harry Potter world, to houses in Hogwarts, their respective teachers, as well as borrowing latin for names of spells and words from other languages as names for characters-- Malfoy (quoting wikipedia) is derived from Old French ""mal foi"" or ""mal foy,"" which means ""bad faith"" or ""bad trust"". The Old French mal foy itself is derived from Latin mala fide, which as a judicial term means intentional mischief, ill will or evil intentions.(/quoting wikipedia) Grimmauld place is also a pun on ""grim old place."" As far as the pacing, it takes into realistic account the rest and hunger the characters go through with no detail spared as to when and what the characters eat. For some reason this makes a story more effective to me, call me weird, I like reading about people eating. Though while I read the Odyssey this made me put the book down more than a few times because it made me hungry. Anyhow, the constant thread through these books was the final showdown that had to happen between Harry and Voldemort, though I think I would have read them anyway for her generously detailed fantastic world...I was surprised Harry didn't die. I really thought it was going to happen and was a little disappointed with the end, mostly because the meeting with Dumbledore in the train station purgatory was a bit much of a deus ex machina for me. I know she had to vindicate Dumbledore and I thought that was fine but something about it was too clean and easy without her usual foreshadowing. I knew Snape would be vindicated in the end! I loved how she rounded out his story, all that was perfect. I was a huge fan of the way in which Rowling discredited the phrase ""for the greater good"" probably much to the confusion of most of her younger readers. Was a little taken aback at the vague comparison of that to the holocaust, how she wrote something like ""for the greater good"" was on the gates of a place where Grindewald killed people but it drove the point home. The Elder Wand ownership thing was...it was like she painted herself into a corner and had to get it resolved before she could finish the book, made the final duel a bit too, er, complex. But my favorite moment in all of these books came at the end of chapter 35 right before Harry regains consciousness for the final battle. It was the most elegant way to finish out this series that has made millions of children into avid readers:""Tell me one last thing,"" said Harry. ""Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?""Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry's ears even though the bright mist was descending again obscuring his figure.""Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?""","Jul 30, 2007"

I think I've made it quite clear throughout my years on Goodreads how much the Harry Potter series and world means to me, but I have yet to do any kind of review on any of the books. This series means so much to so many people, it gave me friends and family when I had none, and most importantly, the courage to be myself. There are so many wonderful things about this series, how detailed the world is, the history, the myriad of different characters. But maybe my favourite part of the story is how realistic the characters are. They are without a doubt flawed, Harry often acting too quick (and without much thought) while trying to carry the world on his shoulders, Ron's feeling of intense jealousy that follow him through the whole series and Hermione's sometimes narrow mindedness. These are the things that made me fall in love with theses characters, I could see myself in them and they never made me feel less then—they made mistakes just like every other human being. This has marked I think close to the twelfth time I have reread this series, and every time it somehow manages to shape the person I turn into. Every time I read this series there is a new problem I am facing, a different quality in myself I am battling with and I always feel like I take some kind of knowledge from this series from all different characters. I think that no matter where I am in the world or what I am doing, the wizarding world of Harry Potter will always be my home.  So until next time, I will miss you.","Nov 27, 2016"

It is an extremely bloated book in which nothing much happens for chapters upon chapters because Rowling is dragging the storyline out -- so it can end at the end of the school year, like all the other books. Many plotlines of previous books are barely touched upon (S.P.E.W.) or ""resolved"" in an entirely dissatisfactory manner (Grawp, though I wasn't unhappy about not seeing more of him). Characters who were hyped in interviews but turned out to be of little importance include Ginny Weasley, who winds up doing absolutely nothing of relevance throughout the whole book, whereas she was annoyingly and tediously present (and acting like a complete jerk) in Half-Blood Prince. Despite my dislike of this character, I had expected to see much more of her, and I was disappointed to see her true purpose was bearing Harry Potter's childrens in one of the, if not the, least believable ""romances"" of the series.The book, and the series, then end with a cloying epilogue which tells us little about things that actually matter and instead focuses on who marries who, complete with precocious children (who are naturally of similar ages; so considerate of everyone to get pregnant at the same time!) and insipid names (Albus Severus, but no child named after Ginny's dead brother?). I like to pretend this epilogue, or ""crapilogue"" as disappointed fans have dubbed it, doesn't exist, and that the series officially ends after Harry kills Voldemort. Leaves much more to the imagination and is much more of a fitting end.My expectations prior to the release were faily high. That turned out to be a mistake.

El primero lo leí hace dos años y ayer terminé el último. Más de cuatro mil páginas repletas de magia, aventura, humor (al menos en su inicio) y grandes personajes. Rowling con el pasar de los libros deja a un lado un estilo literario más cuidado para centrarse en la trama, es más concisa a la hora de describir y dibujar las escenas. Me gustaba más en ese aspecto al inicio, no obstante la trama no te suelta en ningún momento, está hilvanada a la perfección, redonda, increíble aquí el trabajo de la autora. Y vas viendo la evolución de los personajes y conociendo las interioridades y tormentos de muchos de ellos. Dota a todos sus personajes de su propia voz personal, estos es realmente complicado a la hora de escribir pero ella lo logra con gran naturalidad y maestría. Apenas con un par de pinceladas te sirve en bandeja al personaje, su forma de hablar y su personalidad. Me he reído mucho con Hermione y Ron. Se hacen querer. Por otro lado Snape es un personajazo, de mis favoritos. Y aquí podría meter una retahíla de diferentes personajes (los Weasley en general, Sirius, Lupin, Voldemort y sus inicios, la odiosa Dolores Umbridge, Hagrid, Dumbledore, etc…) que alargarían esto más de la cuenta. Así que resumiendo ha sido todo un placer leer esta saga aunque haya sido tan tarde, de la que me he hecho fan y no puedo esperar ya a visitar la Harry Potter: The Exhibition que van a montar en Madrid.

"9780545010221","142079","Cristin","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142079-cristin","Upon further reflection...I think this installment could have been much better. Perhaps Rowling was freaking out under the enormous pressure...never expecting her series to be so wildly adored by so many...Still, this book left something to be desired, I think. Rowling made so many predictable moves...and not even the ones that would have had more of an impact...Snape could have been the hero of the entire series, for example. It would have been rather ironic, considering the fact that he's been the object of every one's disdain--which would have made an outright act of heroism all the more outstanding. I understand that he made a significant contribution to Harry's safety, and Snape's storyline was heartbreaking and interesting...but he could have openly faced Voldermort. He could have raged and fought--he was a powerful wizard, after all... Snape should have gone out with a bang, I think--instead of a blood-soaked whimper. Also..The necklace around Ron's neck...bringing all of his envy and mistrust to the surface...Where have we seen this before? (just take a glance at the Lord of the Rings)...Harry and Ron have already had that fight about inequity in popularity...been there, done that...Why revisit it in such an awkward, hackneyed way?The gratuitous deaths also bother me. If you're going to kill a character off, kill one who is critical to Harry's development. Make Harry a three dimensional character! Do something earth-shattering to him! Also--merely showing a pile of dead bodies on the floor doesn't drive the point home. Some peripheral characters were cast off, as though their deaths were intended to evoke a certain emotion--yet they were clearly not considered important enough to be given more than a page of recognition upon their demise...What does that lead the reader to feel about those characters? Also, why the hell did Harry spend such a huge swath of the book sitting in a tent like a big doofus? Why didn't Rowling use all of those pages to illustrate the maturation of Harry's skill as a wizard--to give us some details as far as Voldemort was concerned...why wasn't there more conflict there? Why am I taking all of this so damn seriously is a better question...bleh.There were some interesting bits in this book. I guess it's time for me to state it--there's better young adult fantasy out there...series that deserve just as much, if not much more recognition...as they are better written, better rendered, etc. I do think of Harry Potter with fondness, however. Perhaps it's the combination of book and film...perhaps it's because so many friends of mine adore the books...I like them for their entertainment value...These are good pleasure reads--and could have been elevated to something much more. Perhaps my expectations were too high for this one.","Jul 23, 2007"

Again.And I'm utterly shattered, but I'm also in a state of ecstasy because of how the many pieces of the puzzle the Harry Potter series is fitted. Seriously, I can't think of no other series of book so cautiously planned, in which all the details are important and everything - everything - makes sense in the way this does in the end.It was about time I truly appreciated what a fantastic world J.K. Rowling created with this series. As I had said before, I didn't really love this series before this reread - I simply liked it, and that was enough for me to not get the fweels and not to be in pain because of all the deaths that happened.Deaths which, by the way, made the book better and worse at the same time. Worse because duh, characters we learned to love no longer were; and better... because well, doesn't that prove how brave an author Rowling is? She doesn't go the safe, sugar-coated way. She goes in the painful and realistic one, even though this was not supposed to be a book for adults.This book is not my favourite in the series (that place goes for both The Goblet of Fire and The Prisoner of Azkaban), but it's still brilliant. The plot gets more complex than before, it's more action-packed and intense, and all the loose strings in the series finally get attached, that is to say, the missing explanations are given and the last twists delivered, some of which include this:Oh, Snape. A complex character, that one was. I never hated him. I admit sometimes I loathed him when he was unfair towards his students, but it was passing anger and I got over it; besides, he was a damn genius in Potion-making and magic in general. Now after reading book 7, I realised I actually feel kind of bad for him. All the life he didn't have... and all because he wallowed in his past.I'm eternally grateful for my decision of rereading this series. During it, I infected my brothers with HP obsession love, and I finally became one of those people who see the world of HP as real as our Muggle world, because as Albus Dumbledore said,Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?It'd be a lie if I say I'll never get over this series - I've gotten over worse things (i.e. The Monstrumologist) - but nonetheless I'll never forget about this journey, and of course, I'll always keep it in my heart, no matter how cheesy and unlike me that sounds.","Feb 18, 2014"

Of course this also gets 5*s becuase I adore this entire series and there's no reason not to give out 5*s to an entire series. On the reread this one had me crying and babbling in happiness and sadness alike many times. I truly think that the power of love and friendship shine throughout this whole book and I just found it moving and magical.

"9780545010221","38467984","India","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38467984-india","POSSIBLE SPOILERSRating:After all this book has put me through and has been dragged through itself, it deserves a 5 star rating. Especially since it is the conclusion to such a beautiful series.Plot:My Blurb:Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, is supposed to be in his last year at Hogwarts, enjoying the time with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.Instead, he has been forced to grow up fast, suffering through death, hardships, and even duels.Still stricken by the death of one of the most important people in his life, Harry sets off with Ron and Hermione to find the remaining Horcruxes that will destroy Lord Voldemort.The task proves a daunting one, but with the help of his friends, and some unknown people, he may be able to succeed.If he does, he may finally be able to put an end to the evil in his world, creating a better place for all.My Commentary:This book.This. Book.It killed me.Harry and his friends have to go through a lot of crap in this book. The bias, the society, the prejudice.Harry has to hide his face everywhere he goes, even at Bill and Fleur's wedding. Almost everyone is against him, and those who we think are with him, well, some of them end up betraying the trust. Some of them are people we would never expect that from. And then there are the people who we thought for sure were against Harry but end up being on his side.I can't even express how much this book infuriated, overjoyed, excited, scared, and everything me.Characters:Harry Potter:Harry is still pretty perfect. He forgives Dumbledore, he forgives Snape, he forgives Ron, he tries to save Peter Pettigrew, he saves Draco and his cronies, he even gives Voldemort a chance. I mean, seriously, this guy? Amazing.Harry knows what it takes to save everyone; he knows very well that this could end in his death. But he is willing to sacrifice that if it means keeping everyone else safe.For that, I admire him as a character and as a person. His development throughout this series is incredible and the changes he brings to the Wizarding world are even greater.Ron Weasley:Ron has to once again deal with the pressure of being The Boy Who Lived's best friend. He has to fight his feelings for one of his best friends since he does not want to hurt his other friend. He is struggling still to find his own destiny without being shadowed by Harry Potter's. He's not really sure where he fits into all the plans until he finds it himself.Hermione Granger:Hermione. God, Hermione. She is so fierce, so strong, so passionate. She changes her parents' memories to be like she never existed. If that's not a savage move right there, I don't know what is. She sticks with Harry even when Ron gives up on him, and she does not waver from the quest. She knows what they need to do and she is not ready to surrender.Ginny Weasley:I love this girl. She is not afraid to kick butt or to show that she can. She will defend herself and the people she loves until she can't anymore. She is so much like Harry; they are the perfect match.She, Luna, and Neville, along with a ton of other Hogwarts students, kept the D.A. running so that they could support Harry from afar. That is just so great. I love Ginny.Luna Lovegood:Luna Lovegood? Oh! You mean my favorite character EVER? That Luna Lovegood?She is eccentric and odd, but with that brings her uniqueness and strength. She is her own person completely and does not hesitate to express herself. Even when held captive, Luna does not waver but spends her time trying to find a way to escape with the others. Harry admires her so, Ron thinks she is just the greatest thing, and Hermione is one of her best friends. Luna's personality is so great, and I wish I had someone like her in my life.Neville Longbottom:Neville, the awkward, clumsy, dim Neville Longbottom, has transformed into a hero. He helped Harry defeat Voldemort. Not in a small, cheesy way, but in a HUGE, nessecary way. He was scared and impressionable, but he helped the D.A. and the journey to defeating Voldemort in an incredible way.I just love this chubby, awkward kid. And I love Matthew Lewis in the movies but for reasons other than his personality. . . .Draco Malfoy:He is just one of those villains I can't bring myself to hate. His personality was terrible, yes, but beneath all of that, he was a vulnerable boy whose choices were fogged by his parents. He did not get to choose who he was. His entire life, he spent it shadowed in the legacy of his father, Lucius Malfoy, the Death Eater.He was not evil. He wasn't really a villain.He was the son who never got a choice. He was a young man who needed a second chance. He was a student, like all others, who needed to learn. He was just a boy who needed saving, even if he didn't want to admit it.Plus I ship Dramione, so there's that.Fred Weasley:*sniff**stifles sobs*George Weasley:I cannot express my love for these twins. My sympathy for George is immeasurable. For the whole family it is.I don't think George is ever ok after what happens in the Battle of Hogwarts. I don't think he ever healed wholly, but I do believe that his family helped him. He found a wife, I know, and they had 2 kids. Roxanne and Fred.Of course, there was Fred. Of course he cried, he hurt, he yelled. Of course his children wondered why their dad cried and why their mum had to comfort him. Fred wanted to know whose memeories it was that made his dad smile. George told his kids stories, I'm sure. They know who Uncle Fred is, even if they won't meet him.I hope George got better. I really do.Bill and Fleur Weasley:Geez, The Golden Trio owes Bill and Fleur their lives. He kept them safe when they barely escaped from death. They healed Hermione after she was tortured. They . . . gave up the spot in their yard . . . I can't . . .Percy Weasley:I had honestly forgotten about Percy until he showed up again. In the beginning books, I liked him, then I hated him, and now I love him. He's still not a huge character, but he is sorry, and he has a heart, which is what matters.Molly Weasley:This lady. She accepted Harry as her own even when her family was already so big. She would do anything for her family. She was devestated when she lost one, she was fierce when she fought for one, and she loved when she saw all of them.She was ready to sacrifice herself for her children and she used the only mildly violent curse word in the whole series for herself. Of course, there were Ron's frequent outbursts, but really, Molly gets the fame.She took on Bellatrix for her daughter. And! And! She defeated her!Molly Weasley, everyone.Arthur Weasley:His excitement with the Muggle world is great. He has such a curious mind that wants to explore everything. This is usually something reserved for a child, but Arthur has it too.Remus Lupin:The last Marauder standing. I guess a group that tight knit must all have similar destinies.He is such an amazing guy. All around. Sure there were times where I was annoyed with him because he didn't appreciate Tonks, or he was going to leave his son, or he was going to sacrifice everything, but in the end, I cried for him.When he asked Harry to be the godfather for his son, I was so touched. I had so many feelings combined into one ball of emotion, and I'll admit that I teared up.He would be such a wonderful dad, no matter what he thought.He may have denied his love for Tonks, but it did show in this book. It was a messy, complicated relationship, but beautiful nonetheless.Nymphadora Tonks:Tonks is supportive, protective, and determined. Her first thought in the battle was of her husband's safety, and their journeys finished together. They brought a new life into the world, and yes, their son may be confused as to why his mum and dad left him, but he will be loved. He will have Andromeda, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, the kids, everyone.Anyway, this is about Tonks, not Teddy. She is hilarious too. Her hair and her features and ""Don't call me Nymphadora.""Oh, Tonks . . .Severus Snape:Snape, Snape, Severus Snape.So . . . Some of you are going to hate me for saying this but . . .I still don't really like him.*winces* Is it over?I know, I know! His story, Lily, jealousy! Yes, it's all very heartbreaking, and I like him a lot more than I used to, but I still don't really like him.All those years, he was terrible to Harry. Maybe it was to protect him, because he reminded Snape of the Potters. I don't deny that, but at the same time, just because Snape loved Lily, I can't forgive him for all he has done.Snape was Neville's boggart. His biggest fear.Harry was not scared of Snape as Neville was, no, but he was intimidated by him.James Potter may have been a bully when he was a teenager, but Snape grew into a bully. Snape chose the dark arts over Lily; James changed for the woman he loved. That was the difference.Not that I'm glad Snape is gone, because I think he deserved a chance to redeem himself to Harry or prove that he wasn't evil, but I after going through all the tormenting with Harry though the books, I just can't bring myself to forgive him as Harry did.Harry, you are a much more forgiving person than I.Minerva McGonagall:She is such a savage, this lady. Her wizard mind tricks (and physical tricks) are what make her so cool. My love for her can't be expressed in words. And when she was upset about Harry, I loved her even more.She is such a fierce lady and she should he headmaster. I don't know what I would do without her. Haha.Voldemort:He comes last. Ol' Voldy. Probably the most evil of them all. Except for Umbridge of course. But this isn't about her.I think that he thought what he was doing was ok. He thought it was for the good of the Wizarding World. It was not, but he didn't know. His childhood and adulthood were demented and tortured. He didn't know what was wrong and what was right.Harry gave him a chance to apologize for his wrongdoings. Harry gave him a chance to be human again.Voldemort didn't want to be human. He wanted to be the monster he was. But in the end, he died with ""mundane finality"", showing that he was really just Tom Riddle.Author:Good old JK. She is so brilliant. Her story is an inspiring one that proves to everyone that nothing is really impossible if you have enough nerve. If we're quoting Ginny.She went through such a dark time, but she turned it around. Now she is a wife, a mother, she is happy. And that's all anyone could ever ask for: happiness.Recommended To:I doubt there are many people who haven't read Harry Potter, but I didn't read it for the first time until now, and that's WAY behind everyone else, just like I tell you about below. But everyone needs to read these books.Overall:This was my last read of 2015. It was a great finale. The twists, the turns, and the loops send you for a wild ride in this book. I could not have asked for a better conclusion to Harry Potter and to 2015.I am definitely glad I read them. Most people read these when they were 9 or 10. I did start the first book in 3rd or 4th grade, I think, but I didn't really enjoy it. Now, I am glad I picked them up. Thank God for my neighbor who lent them and the movies to me or I never would have gone back to these books. I would have remembered picking them up and ended it there. Now I have completed the reading, no matter how long it took me, but it finally happened!I may not have grown up with these books or had them shape my life, but they have built within me a deeper appreciation for literature itself, those who did shape their lives around these books, and for the great novelty of this series.Everyone needs to know the story of Harry Potter, his friends, his family, his determination, his passion, his forgiveness, his selflessness, his bravery, his sacrifice, and most of all, his strength. Because his strength, will make you stronger. And everyone could use a little more strength.For lack of any possibly better word, this was a truly magical series.","Jun 22, 2015"

I don't want to spoil your world view.Sexuality, Adolescence and Harry PotterOne of the funny things about the original discussion and the response to it is the lack of recognition of how important sexuality actually (and overtly) is to HP, especially later in the series.It defies me how people expect someone to write about or think about or progress through adolescence without considering sex or sexuality.Heartstring Wands and Love TrianglesFor me, HP is a love triangle in which there is enormous sexual tension around who will end up with Hermione by the time they escape the chains of adolescence.Obviously, JKR for her own reasons avoids the obvious temptation to let Harry end up with Hermione.However, right up until the last moment, there is some doubt as to whether Ron will get the girl.It's totally misguided to think that HP's adolescent audience isn't right on top of this issue.In fact, they're probably way ahead of most adults in the audience (including me).Let's DanceIn the first Deathly Hallows film, Harry and Hermione dance together, while Ron remains banished in the wild.This was a tipping point in the story, when Hermione might possibly have reversed her sexual selection.When I saw the film, a whole group of kids burst out laughing in this scene.I still don't know whether I missed something (was it Harry's seriousness or clumsiness?), but I was too busy concentrating on the soundtrack and trying to work out its significance.The Ship Song[I wrongly thought] the song was Nick Cave's ""The Ship Song"", which was the last thing I expected to hear in a HP film.It's a great melody, but if you have a look at the lyrics, you have to wonder what was intended by the director, at least.http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/n/nickc...Did Harry create a ""little mystery"" with Hermione?Did Hermione loose her dogs on Harry? Or let her hair hang down?Did Harry have to remove her wings, so that she could try to fly in her own right?Did Hermione have to escape Harry's legendary pull, so she could find happiness?I wish I could have asked those kids.Post Script:I just asked my 12 year old daughter why people laughed at that scene, and she said (in this order) ""because they weren't together"" (i.e., a recognised couple) and ""because they were goofy"".

"9780545010221","858949","Chris","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/858949-chris","I liked it. I really did. I laughed, I cheered, I said ""Holy SHIT!"" at least twice.... I even got a little choked up at some points. All in all, I'd say it was a successful end to the series. Ms. Rowling deserves to take a little time off and enjoy basking in the glow of the knowledge that she has not only written seven successful books in ten years, but created an entire world that is big enough to fit hundreds more.Anyway, about this actual book. It felt a lot longer than the rest of them did, probably because of the format change - no more Hogwarts, no more Quidditch, points gained, points lost, detentions with Snape and all that. Our Heroes were kept on the run for pretty much the entire book, so that by the time you get to the climax you think, ""Wow, did they do all that in just 500 pages? A wedding, a break-in at the Ministry, a break-in at Gringotts, a major battle in the Malfoy mansion, a brush with death at Godrick's Hollow and all that in just 500 pages? Hot damn....""Speaking of Gringotts, that's one of the many reasons I liked this book. Rowling told us in book one that you'd have to be a fool to break into Gringotts, and most authors would require you to take it on their word. But she went and showed us, and came up with a hell of a scenario.As much fun as it was finding out that Dumbledore was just as obnoxious in his youth as most of us are was cool, it did feel a bit forced. The entire scene where Aunt Muriel lectured Doge on Dumbledore's youthful indiscretions and mysterious family goings-on should have just WARNING: EXPOSITION stamped on it in red. I'm not sure what the purpose of it was, other than to humanize Dumbledore and to give us a lead-in to the Deathly Hallows. Which I'm still of two minds about anyway. As cool as the idea was, I don't think we should have had to wait until this late in the series to find out about them. At the end of Half-Blood Prince, Harry's path is straight and sure - Horicruxes all the way - and now we have this distraction in the Hallows. Also deserving of the EXPOSITION stamp: Snape's final memories in the Pensieve and Harry's last conversation with Dumbledore.I don't know, maybe it was to give him the choice between destroying Voldemort and defeating Voldemort or something. I haven't really processed it all yet, since I did read the book at approximately Mach 4, which is not the recommended reading speed. Perhaps I'll be more comfortable with the Hallows in the re-read.And then there was the camping sequence. I get it - they're lost in more ways than one. I suspect this may have been an artifact of the one book = one year format. It was probably also meant to keep us in a sense of heightened danger, but that's pretty much where I felt the book drag.Okay, now that I'm done nit-picking...DEATH!Ms. Rowling said in an interview that this book ""isn't a bloodbath.""Oh really? 1. Hedwig - This was Rowling saying, ""I'm not fucking around. I've just killed Harry's most faithful companion, his tether to the world in which he belongs. Imagine what else I'm planning."" 2. Mad-Eye Mooney - A fallen warrior, just like the chapter title says. I think Mad-Eye would have been surprised to survive this battle - of all the Order of the Phoenix he seemed most in tune with the reality that they faced. 3. Dobby - This was where I got choked up, I don't mind telling you. Dobby didn't deserve a knife in the heart. Hell, he didn't deserve to die at all. Having said that, he died very well, and his death was handled with dignity. It was also another reminder from Rowling - ""See? I killed off another completely innocent character. You people have no idea what you're in for...."" 4. Wormtail - Devious bastard. Good riddance. I would have liked to have seen more of his super-hand in action, though. What was it truly capable of? 5. Crabbe - We finally hear him speak! And we find out he's been hiding his light under a bushel. Too bad it then proceeded to burn up the bushel, and the room it was in. 6. Fred - I hate being right. Dammit. 7. Snape - Ah yes, Snape. This was done well. She kept us wondering right up to the end, and it paid off. I seriously thought he was on the dark side, but that's probably because I have no faith in real human beings, much less fictional ones. Now since I'm not a fan-fictioner, or a 'shipper, I never caught on to the idea that Snape and Lily might have had any relationship prior to Hogwarts. I thought her reaction to James' hazing was simply out of compassion for her fellow human being. I had no idea. Anyway, it's good to be wrong. Knowing everything will certainly make re-reads a little more interesting.... 8. Remus and 9. Tonks - There seems to be a lot of anger out there about the way they died - off-screen and without much impact. A lot of people appear to have a lot invested in their relationship, which surprised me. I thought they were an interesting couple, and the idea of their child was very fertile ground for future storytelling, but their relationship was never a central storyline to begin with. Every step of it was happing without the reader's knowledge. It was just revealed to us through Harry. Their courtship, their wedding, their child and their death, none of it was meant to be - and I know I'm going to get snapped at for this - important. They were a nice couple, but as we've already seen, ""nice"" doesn't exempt you from dying in this book. If you want to get analytical about it, it is probable that the orphaning of young Ted Lupin was meant to provide a positive mirror to Harry's own experience: here is another child of a wizarding family whose parents were taken from him before he even knew who they were. Unlike Harry, though, Ted will have a loving, supportive extended family to look after him and see that he's brought up right. For his part, Harry will be able to redeem Sirius in that he can be the godfather that Sirius never was. So while the deaths of Remus and Tonks was regrettable, it was not wrong. 10. Colin Creevey - The grace note. One last reminder from Rowling that she plays no favorites with the supporting cast, and a reminder that being innocent and nice and likable won't be enough to save you. See Remus and Tonks. 11. Voldemort - Definitely dead, if the epilogue is to be believed. So there.That's a pretty impressive body count, not including all the nameless characters who died and the people who only got seriously maimed. And it was this willingness to be brutal to her characters that made me love Rowling all the more....Let's see, what else.... Yes, Mrs. Weasley is my hero, and hopefully we can get Sigourney Weaver to play her in the movie. And Neville finally lived up to his promise. He could have been in Harry 's place, and he finally proved that he could have been every bit the hero that Harry was. Bravo for him. And his grandmother kicks ass in every way, shape and form....I loved the callback to Sorcerer's Stone. In that book, Harry, Ron and Hermione were trying to get past Devil's Snare, which can be repelled by fire. Hermione laments that they don't have any wood, to which Ron replies, ""have you gone mad? Are you a witch or not?"" In this book, while trying to get past the Whomping Willow, Ron moans that if they only had Crookshanks with them, they could hit the secret knot and freeze the limbs. To which Hermione replies, ""Crookshanks? Are you a wizard or what?"" Bless Rowling's heart for trusting us to be paying enough attention to get that joke.I really wish we could have seen Dolores Umbridge get her comeuppance. Imagine this scene from chapter 31, The Battle of Hogwarts.... Umbridge dashed as quickly as her legs would take her through the carnage. She was nearly hit by blast after blast of green light coming from wands carelessly aimed. Her thoughts ran on one track - I have to get out of here. She turned the corner and ran into a resilient, pinkish wall. She barely had time to register what it was before Grawp clenched his fist around her. ""Release me!"" she screamed. ""I am the senior assistant to the Minister of -"" And then Grawp ate her.Ahh, the poetry. She was an evil word-that-rhymes-with-runt and deserved to be punished.Oh, also, Pansy Parkinson: ""But he's right there!"" Winner of Hogwarts' first Slowest on the Uptake Award. That was a great moment. I would have liked to have seen a few of her fellow Slytherins stand up as well, but I guess it's tough to go against your own House.The epilogue was a good idea, if rushed. There was a flood of information that needed to be processed in only a few pages, and I see no reason why she couldn't have let it out for a few more pages. It's not like we were going to get to ""Nineteen Years Later...."" and just give up because the epilogue was too long. But it serves its purpose - it lets us know that after all that we'd seen, everything eventually works out. Not right away, and not perfectly - note that after all the talk about not allowing themselves to be divided, there are still houses at Hogwarts and Slytherin is still the ""evil"" one - but all in all everything's okay.Which brings us to my final thought, at least for now: I said at the beginning that Rowling has earned herself a nice break. She's put in a lot of work and reaped massive rewards, both tangible and intangible. But I suspect that she won't be able to rest for long. There is so much Story there, just waiting to be told. The fans will certainly take a stab at it, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone's already written a threesome between Albus Potter, Scorpius Malfoy and Teddy Lupin.Anyway, that's a whole lot more than I was planning to write, and I'm pretty sure I left things out. But there it is, my thoughts on Deathly Hallows. A good end to a good series.","Feb 01, 2008"

"9780545010221","5223517","John Egbert","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5223517-john-egbert","I wasn't happy with my previous review, and decided to re-write it.I will round all of my dislikings of this book to three things;1. The PlotholesOh, JK Rowling. You and your plotholes. Firstly, we have the issue brought up many times by others -- the time turner. I assume Minerva McGonagall had more of those, since she was able to just give Hermione one. Wouldn't they come in handy when everyone was dying? Why not turn back the clock and warn someone about what was going to happen? After all, as shown in the fourth book time is not set in the Harry Potter world.Secondly, we have the confusion of the ending. How did Harry come back to life? Can someone explain this to me? I thought his mother's love broke when he turned seventeen. How did Voldemort die, but he lived? Why can't Volemort kill a seventeen year old boy with seemingly infinite magical knowledge? The first four books it was cute how Harry kept escaping, but then it started to get confusing. Is there another magic at work here, besides Dumbldedores love? Can we make this more clear? Sigh. Believe me, love is cool and all, but love won't solve all your problems. What about hard work and perseverance? We have a little of that, but not as much as there should be. Love is the answer to everything, I guess, but there comes a time when you need to be practical. That time is when people are dying and you know, you're seventeen and not eleven and you're a chosen one and hey, things are starting to get serious.2. Hermione Granger's Lonely Hearts ClubI really wanted to use that. Moving on,I admit, I ship her with Harry. However, that is not why I'm miffed at her ending up with Ron. From book one, Ronald Weasly has belittled her, underestimated her, called her stupid, annoying, hinted that she was ugly, ignored her, yet begged her to do his homework, and promptly not proved that he deserved her affections at all.And yet, we have book seven, they're supposed to be in love????Now, I'm not going to pretend like she hasn't been mean to him too, but let's face it -- Hermione was never a jerk towards Ron without reason. He usually always did something to provoke her first, like call her a know it all, ask her to the Yule ball at the last moment, say that she has no friends, imitate her, act as if he was above her and generally be a prat with the ""emotional range of a teaspoon"" as she so fittingly states.We are not given any reason as to why she should be in love with Ron. We are just told that she is. That bugs me.3. Why Do Donuts Have To DieMaybe that last title was a bit random. By donuts, I mean excessive amounts of minor characters.I know it isn't meant to be this way, but to me as the reader, it seems that JK Rowling killed off a lot of minor characters to sub for one major character. Since I didn't like any of the minor characters she killed off, I guess it seemed gratuitous to me. I mean, I just didn't care that much. Granted, there are casualties in war, but it seemed like she was showing this off at the end to seem badass. It didn't work. It was just annoying.BONUS TIME!4. Some Scars Can't Be SeenWhere's the emotional scarring? Everybody ends up happily married at the end, as if a horrible war hadn't taken place but twenty years earlier. They were tortured for the love of god -- some of them were even locked in a dark cellar for weeks on end! Tell me that isn't scarring. Please do.In conclusion,I gave the book one star for a reason. Despite that, there are some things I did like about it;1. Snape!2. Dean, Luna, and Oliver.3. ...Snape?4. We got a lot of Harry/Hermione bonding scenes, even if they were ignored.I'm sure there were other things, but I can't remember them/am too lazy to go into them right now.Keep in mind, I like the Harry Potter series and think JK Rowling is a pretty decent author. But this book just didn't do it for me.","Apr 04, 2011"
"9780545010221","3048260","Erin ☕ *Proud Book Hoarder*","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3048260-erin-proud-book-hoarder","“Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second.” I'm sure everyone knows what I mean when I say it's both a good and a bad thing that I've finished the series. Good because I've experienced it all, bad because it's now over.I knew the plot before going in because the last movie was the freshest in my mind, so I braced myself for the deaths that were coming, revelations that jumped out to reveal themselves, and the creative wrap-up. Rowling used her imagination at top form to show the hidden natures of some of the characters we previously viewed as villains, backstories of heroes, and twists in escaping death and losing for Harry Potter himself.Since it was the last book, it was the darkest as the battle reigned supreme for Hogwarts and Harry and his friends - they finally had to face that final fight, leaving no one unscathed. My favorite part was definitely at the school when the battle was waging. McGonagall remains a favorite, I wish we knew about her story afterward. Bellatrix versus Mrs Weasley was an epic time, Neville standing up for his friends, and of course the sad, sad deaths that happened to some series regulars.Truthfully some of the down parts were a little dull at times - Harry and Hermione and Ron wandering around had some interesting scenes though, such as the snake Nagiri in the Hollows scene being so creepy it was like something written out of a horror book. The scene where Harry finds the sword was awesome as well, but it just seemed like a little magic was missing when the gang was separated so long from the school and other characters. Those characters, classes, school, hiding from teachers...all of that was a strong binding substance for the story being as great as it was. It would be nice to know more in the epilogue about what happened to some surviving characters, such as the Weasley's besides Ron and Percy, Luna and her father, and a few others. Hopefully Harry kept Kreacher around as a personal house elf for life. The resolution was sweet since it showed the future and who the main characters got together with, as well as Harry giving an important tribute to two main characters in the naming of his son, but it did feel a little off for some reason, not sure why. It almost felt a little forced. It answers marriage and kids but what about careers and other stuff? I know some wanted Harry to end up with another girl in the series, but I'm happy with how it ended. Even J.K. Rowling herself now says she wish she had done that differently, but I think she made the right decision the first time.As evil as Voldemort was, he made a memorable villain. On the other side of the coin, Harry and his friends made intelligent and worthy heroes. I'll miss the school and the stories - everything from laughing and learning, to fighting and plotting. I'll miss the characters who were killed off, and wonder what happened to those left behind. I still think it would have been more interesting had a certain professor lived and played a part in the ending.Of course this series couldn't last forever, but it's good the author wrote seven lengthy books that are impossible to forget. Long live in the magic.","Dec 16, 2012"
"9780545010221","542037","Annalisa","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa","What can I say but genius? All along I have considered myself a mild Harry Potter fan, but once you get to the end and Rowling wraps up all the minute details she plants from book one you cannot help but be amazed at her creativity. Building on each of the books, writing each one at a slightly higher level as the characters grow up, all the details, and lets not forget the insignificant matter of the entire world evolving to hold a joint consciousness of Harry Potter. Children's literature has boomed and for that alone I give her immense credit.We are finally rewarded with Ron and Hermione. I am finally justified in Snape being my favorite character. We get to see the emotion to McGonagall and the history of Dumbledore. And of course, we finally, after 4100 pages, get to see the face off between good and evil, see what powers truly lie in Harry, and discover how strong our own allegiance to the boy really are. Rowling satisfies both camps on Harry's fate (without having to scar the boy with a task like Snape's) and even me who cared more about Snape's destiny than Harry's. Yes the book is long and there are a few scenes in the Forest of Deans and at Bill & Fleur's that drag, but they are spaced out and there is so much else packed in to reward you for a few pages spent just as frustrated as the hero trio. Besides my favorite scene happens in that lonely forest when Harry finds the sword. But once the action winds back to Hogwarts, the book is nearly impossible to put down. The wand loyalties could have been explained better, but overall the complexity of the plot and resolution were impressive.The emotion in the book is so strong. Maybe it's that after all these years and all these books, you feel so committed to the characters, but you can't help but feel so full of emotion, and even I'll admit it cry, at the height of the story. I don't think there's an emotion you don't feel in reading this book, but the strongest one is in the end when you have to close the book and say goodbye to the chapter in your life tied up in the story. I can't read this book without feeling sad at the end that it is over.My favorite thing about book 7 is the way it ends, back at King's Cross where your view shifts from seeing Harry's adventures as a lost 11-year-old about to have a fantastic journey to a caring adult guiding a broken boy through the pain and challenges he is about to endure and conquer on this spectacular journey.

Say, it's all real and you're part of that magical world.Say, Cedric Diggory was your boyfriend, and Voldemort killed him. Or if your a guy, Moaning Myrtle was your girlfriend and Tom Riddle set a Basilisk on her.You'll hope that DA would win over the Dark Side, and that Harry gets to punish all the Death Eaters with a hundred Cruciatus Curse-for each Death Eater that is- won't you?You'll dream for the day that you'll get to see Bellatrix and Lucius choose Killing curse just because they can't take anymore Cruciatus curse.You're so angry you wanted to kill them yourself. You want to avenge Dumbledore's death.But on your way to Hogsmeade you came across this...................[image error]Oh no!! After all these years they aren't enemies at all! They've been friends all along. All these years of believing they loathed each other. All these years and Voldemort has got a nose all along. Well Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is something like this. All those years of waiting for that Epic epic finale, you get 2 paragraphs of a fight between Voldemort and Harry. I was expecting Harry would use the killing curse at least. But he didn't. The upside though is he used Cruciatus Curse on the Carrows. HAH!!!!! Ooohh I loved that part. Makes me swell with happiness.I don't mind that J.K killed awful lot of characters,(Although I'd be happy to exchange Cho Chang for Fred) I think it was needed to show that the war was indeed gruesome. Because to NOT kill a lot of characters will make DH a wizarding and early version of Breaking Dawn. Where all the characters lived to tell the tale. No, that would be too painfully idealistic. Idealism is not in any way J.K's way of writing. If Harry Potter was too perfect to the point of unreal-ism, then it wouldn't have been the best selling series of all times.I didn't like the ending so much. But the whole book was so great, still epic. Kept me on the edge of my seat. It would hurt me if I give HP less than five stars, and honestly it doesn't deserve anything less than 5 stars. Hell I would even give it a million stars if I could.","Nov 06, 2010"

"9780545010221","3461034","Trish","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3461034-trish","The conclusion to a truly epic series. I’m so happy I made this re-read. All the wonderful memories, the great moments now … Although I usually remember all details the first time, there were some here that I had forgotten about and revisiting them was a delight!After the death of Albus Dumbledore at the end of book #6 Harry, Ron and Hermione have not returned to Hogwarts. Instead, Harry goes back to Privet Drive one last time and then goes to the Burrow. Of course, he is being chased all the time, leading to two tragic deaths right at the beginning of the book (in fact, the casualness with which one of the two was mentioned almost broke my heart). There are some lighter moments in this that give a bit of a respite (like Bill and Fleur’s wedding), but the main tone is that of darkness, loss and action, naturally.While being on the run after the aforementioned wedding, Harry finally puts most of the puzzle pieces together (with the help of not just the smartest witch of his age but also of Kreacher who became mighty sweet) and starts the hunt for the Horcruxes. Between the mad dashes we get a lot of background story, most notably the missing pieces about Albus Dumbledore himself, all the connections to the titular Deathly Hallows and Voldemorts greatest weakness (these bits of history were actually the best part for me, always, not just now that we have the Fantastic Beasts movie(s)).Again, there are some moments that were conveyed better in the movies which came as a bit of a surprise (but it was fun seeing how the movies and books complete each other). Such as the dragon that was chained up in Gringotts giving the impression it knew exactly who freed it and that the kids were sitting on its back so it flew lower to let them off at the lake; the Patronus being such a special feat of magic that not just any happy memory will do to conjure it (a pet peeve of mine with the books ever since book #3); the Grey Lady giving Harry the riddle about the Room Of Requirement; McGonagall being even more kick-ass (without help); and probably most notably (view spoiler)[Dobby’s death that was heartbreaking in the book but translated even better in the movie (which is weird considering that Dobby hadn’t made an appearance between movies #2 and #7.1 so there was never the same kind of redemption as in the books) (hide spoiler)].What I cannot forgive, that they changed for the movies, is the story of Harry’s wand. For anyone who doesn’t remember: Harry’s wand gets snatched almost in half when Harry and Hermione make their escape from Godric’s Hollow – both in the book and the movie. The difference: in the book the core is not broken! And in the end, (view spoiler)[having the Elder Wand, Harry uses it only once – to repair his old and loyal wand (successfully) – before giving it up (in a better/more intelligent/more plausible way than in the movie as well) (hide spoiler)]. That, in my opinion, is crucial. Which is exactly why it borders on blasphemy that it was changed in the movie!Then there were moments that were brilliant but missing from the movies completely, like Neville’s gran (bwahahaha!), Dudley’s goodbye to Harry, Percy finally coming around (and the twins‘ reaction to him coming back). It was small moments like these that glued the action-packed sequences together. Because all the action and the stakes being so high, of course, means that not everyone is going to make it out alive and the readers need to care. In fact, there is quite a number of people who were important supporting characters that didn’t survive the Battle of Hogwarts (most notably (view spoiler)[Fred Weasley (hide spoiler)] for whom I mourned almost the most). And that is one of the greatest strengths of the series if you ask me: even after all these years readers like me cannot stop thinking about this world and its inhabitants, wondering what happened afterwards, obsessing over every little detail throughout the seven books/movies and never waivering in our love for it all. That love means that no matter how many times we read or listen to the books, the tragic events are never less of a blow, the funny moments are never any less funny. The writing is crisp and vivid as it was the very first time and the entire series is a fixed part of the readers‘ life (no matter how old one was when reading it for the first time).","Jul 22, 2011"

"9780545010221","11898426","Jocelyn","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11898426-jocelyn","The Harry Potter series as a whole never really impressed me as much as the hype had led me to expect. Or even close.I can't say I was necessarily disappointed by this book, nor was I pleasantly surprised. The Deathly Hallows has its fair share of weaknesses as well as strengths and in the end it's just...meh.That's it.Meh.It left no lasting impression on me. Just meh. Rowling's strengths lie with developing sympathetic characters (albeit not very interesting ones), writing entertainingly enough for the reader to suspend disbelief in spite of all those numerous holes in her world, and, of course, creating something that appeals so largely to its audience.Rowling's world is nothing particularly special, and yet, it's hard not to be a little ""awww I wish I can go to Hogwarts!"" and ""omg that's so cool!"" So yes, part of the reason why I like this series is because it appeals to my inner fangirl. You could say I enjoy these books for all the wrong reasons. I don't make much of the ""OMG AMAAAAZING PLOT"" like its die-hard fans so ardently proclaim, nor do I find much to admire in the so-called ""deep, complex, and strong"" characters. I mean, yeah, it's all right...but what makes Harry Potter special? Why is it a masterpiece? Why should I like it, see it, approach it as a classic? (Oh, I'm not kidding. We've all heard the repetitive ""Harry Potter will withstand the test of time"" crap.)Writing, in spite of its subjectivity and diversity, can also be a precise art. You can tell when authors know what they're doing and when they don't. In this case, whether Rowling finds her stride when writing or not is quite obvious to the reader; it fluctuates from time to time, some places being stronger and others being weaker and more lazily written.Many fans would say that Rowling is an excellent prose writer--at the very least, ""it's soooo much better than Twilight"" etc. etc.--but is she really?Words and language should be well placed with consistency and precision--each word should serve some kind of purpose, regardless of whether it ties into moving the plot forward--but also with style. In this case it's pretty obvious what Rowling was going for: a simplistic style that was nonetheless vibrant and lively, quick, to-the-point, and basically what she sees as the best possible style for children's stories. But as Harold Bloom so eloquently puts it, ""Rowling's mind is so governed by clichés and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing.""To add to that, Rowling not only overuses those clichés and dead metaphors, but she uses them so flippantly it's very jarring and irritating to the reader. She doesn't place words with a purpose, she places them with carelessness. And that is what I would call lazy writing.You could, in fact, apply that criticism to the rest of this book. Superficially, it looks like Rowling knows exactly what she's doing. She weaves an unoriginal but complex plot, with elements threading together intricately so on the surface, it looks like a work of art. A masterpiece. Complexity is good...right?Well, no. Complexity in and of itself is not good, nor is it bad. In this case how Rowling applied it I would consider to be more than a little haphazard and...hasty. I found HP to be a bit overcomplicated in some ways. That complexity doesn't have a real justification for it, and therefore feels a little overdone and forced. On the surface, like I said, Rowling is a brilliant and creative author who knows exactly what she's doing, but scrutinizing this book, the text easily betrays her lack of confidence as a writer. She pulls plot devices out of the world on a whim so frequently it becomes extremely annoying after a while. I like characters who get out of bad situations on their own merits, not on the merits of the setting. World-building shouldn't be used as a resource for devices to move the story along, it should be used as exactly what it is: a world. It's not there for the author to be lazy, it's there to enrich the story and the reader's experience.The plot elements and devices--Horcruxes, Hallows, etc.--are so last-minute, it's hard not to imagine Rowling going on the Internet, finding out that people had guessed all her ""twists,"" and throwing in a last-minute punch in an attempt to raise more suspense, in addition to lots of red herrings nearly thrown in the reader's path with a complete lack of subtlety, but in the end it's nothing more than frazzling.Plot twists seem to exist more for shock value instead of being driven from the story. Look, it's really annoying when the author catches you at a ""Gotcha suckers!"" moment and you feel like you're being cheated. Aside from being rather belittling and insulting to my intelligence, it's ultimately very pointless. Any benefit that could be gotten out of shocking the reader and nothing more is completely short-term. Character development is just the same--uncertain, last-minute, and rushed. I'm not exactly sure how Harry and his friends develop as real people. I mean, sure, it's easy to point out how Rowling puts them through hell and beats them up at every opportunity, but horrifying experiences do not instantly constitute character development. In this book especially, there was also a loss of intimacy with the characters--the emotional distance between me as a reader and them as characters was so great that I just didn't care about them.Rowling seems to have a little trouble manipulating tone and pacing. The lead-in and buildup to the climax was so jostling and distracting I didn't even realize the climax had come until they started celebrating the defeat of Voldemort. The events building up to the climax were dragged out, while the climax itself wasn't fleshed out to be rewarding enough to compensate for all the dullness and dragging that came before it. Combined, it made for a very unbalanced story structure and haphazard book as a whole.The morality and ""life lessons that are good for children to learn"" are muddled, contrived and forced. Oftentimes I felt that Rowling was deliberately shaping her story and characters to fit the ""ideal"" book and ""strong, likable characters,"" rather than letting those merits develop naturally as the novel progressed. Doing what she did--trying to force her books to fit the mold of society's standards instead of, if she so desired, letting it happen on their own--just makes the novel look so much more fake and lazy as a result.Basically, my main complaint with this book can be boiled down to this: Rowling doesn't know what she's talking about. She seriously doesn't. Everything is so disjointed and strewn all over the place it's pretty obvious that Rowling wrote this not to write a mind-blowing amazing piece of literature, but because she was afraid to disappoint her fans. She got caught up in that fear and focused more on playing it safe, and guess what? The novel suffered because of it.As a reader, it's frustrating when you can tell the author feels incompetent. Not incompetent, but feels incompetent. Rowling doesn't seem confident as a writer, and her writing betrays that to me personally. If the author is isn't sure, then how will the reader ever be? If Rowling isn't willing to take risks, how will this installment ever be anything but just that--safe? Mediocre? Just okay? Nothing more than that?I liked this book. I truly, honestly did. But my enjoyment did not come from this book being actually amazing, it came from its subjective entertainment value. I would call this book an adequate one, not an extraordinary one.","Aug 31, 2012"

Gains more strength through familiar characters and nostalgia than from new developments or understandings. Smacks of the improbably untragic wars of any happy ending; though Rowling's wealth of secondary characters provides a little fodder.Character growth in the likes of Dumbledore, Neville, Kreacher, and the predictably D'arcy-like Snape provide the most interest in the book. Perhaps Rowling was more concerned with closure than constructing a more complex story. Then again, she may just be glad to be free of it after all these years. I do congratulate her on getting out while the getting was good.The epilogue particularly felt like an attempt to make an utter and unapologetic finish to the story. Unfortunately, it will likely not keep the questions at bay. I, myself, couldn't but wonder if the older Harry might have adopted a fatherly middle-class mustache. I'll have to pen a letter.Despite the claims that the books were plotted out and foreshadowed from the beginning, we get a lot of last-minute additions to the world to build toward a convenient plot coupon ending. Rowling was, more-or-less, beyond the power of editors, and I wish she had used that power to write an interesting, audacious book, but this ending was very safe, and free from the surprising plot twists Rowling sometimes managed.I guess she was trying to please her fans, but she had a lot of people to please. Hopefully she pleased some of them, but I was disappointed that as the series neared its end, it became less quirky and character-driven, and more predictable and cliche.My Fantasy Book Suggestions","Jul 18, 2007"

"9780545010221","1713956","Manny","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny","A few minutes after midnight on the release day for The Most Overhyped Book Of All Time, I logged in to Wikipedia and skimmed the plot to see which characters did in fact get killed at the end. Evidently some contributor had had it all wrapped up, and was just waiting for the starting pistol. The next day, I told several Potter fans what I'd done, and quite enjoyed the moment of dead silence that typically greeted my announcement.I'm sorry if this was disrespectful towards the author, but I wasn't burning books, or publicly releasing spoilers, or anything like that. I later borrowed my son's copy and actually read it. With competent editing, I think Potter 7 could perhaps have been quite reasonable. I wonder if J.K. Rowling was genuinely pleased with her work, or just with the enormous amount of money it made for her? My impression was that she wasn't really having fun after the third or fourth volume, but I could be wrong.","Jan 10, 2009"

Don't get me wrong, Harry was my favorite character--brave, deeply loyal, naturally talented--all wonderful qualities not meant for this foul Earth. I wanted him to die in his prime, to be celebrated in song, like all the great heros before him. Alas...Rowling didn't write so much a novel, as she did a Hollywood screenplay! Complete with lame wincing juvenile lines like the one uttered by Molly Weasley to Bellatrix LeStrange in the Battle for Hogwarts, ""Not my daughter, you BITCH!"" A line meant to draw applause, cheers, and laughter from a bunch of teenagers in a darkened movie theater, not a line that would have been used by the prim and proper mother, Molly Weasley, that we grew to know and love in books 1-6.The book could have been better edited as there were long stretches of BORING reading throughout. It's as if Rowling just ran out of creative juices in the end and chose to let her fans write the final book for her. She inserted ""PotterWatch"" as a nod to the PotterCasters(PotterCast and MuggleCast), and she wrote in a nude scene for Harry Potter, as a nod to Daniel Radcliffe's nude stint in Equus. The whole *camping out in the forest waiting for something to happen* part was NOT something I expected after Book 6, when it was shown with such great care how Voldemort had hidden the locket horcrux. I can't believe they are making 2 films out of this, the crappiest book in the series!Oh, and that Epilogue, where to begin? If Rowling sent out apology letters to all her fans for writing it, that still wouldn't be enough of an atonement! The woman should be tarred, feathered, drawn, and quartered for that criminally putrid Epilogue! The visual of a middle aged Harry Potter waiting at the train station to get to his 9 to 5 job was the let-down of the century. I loved Harry because he was special and because of his aura of destiny! I loved that, despite his emotionally abusive childhood, he chose to become a decent human being, instead of following Tom Riddle's path of evil and bitterness! I loved that, when presented with a challenge, he almost always chose to do the right and moral thing, over what was easy. I didn't want to see him become a regular, boring adult, with a lame, humdrum life, he was too talented, too moral, too heroic for all of that mundane crap!","Jun 10, 2008"

I made it to within 15 pages of the end before I had to run out the door or risk missing the tram. HARRUMPH. Anyway. I finished my marathon reread when I got home from trivia at 11pm. I cried over the scene between Harry and Ron. Again. I cried over Fred. Again. I *nearly* cried over Luna and the patronuses scene again, and only didn't because I already had my make up on and no time to fix it if I ended up with mascara all over my damn face. I love everything about this freaking book. The end. 24/12/2016I cried. Again. But over weird things this time?? I cried over the scene where Harry's struggling to produce a patronus because it's the middle of the Battle of Hogwarts and he can't think of anything happy, and Luna - patronus leading the way - tells him that they're all still there, they're all still fighting. FEELINGS. FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELINGS. 31/12/2015Frankly, I'm impressed that I managed to cram this one into the last three days of the year, because I desperately wanted to finish the series this year. And I did - with four hours to spare. *high fives self*For some reason, this reread brought a hell of a lot of emotions with it. The developing relationship between Ron and Hermione gave me feels. Harry's reaction to Lupin turning up gave me feels. All the deaths gave me feels, obviously. Neville proving himself to be a true Gryffindor and his grandmother's pride in him gave me feels. McGonagall's pride and heartbreak over Harry gave me feels. Dumbledore's backstory gave me feels. And I may have broken down and sobbed during the scene between Ron and Harry that I mentioned below. Basically, this book is perfection, and it's hands down my favourite of the series. Now let's just go ahead and pretend that Snape redemption plot never happened... 29/6/2014Everything I said last time around still stands. But one of the things I find most interesting about Deathly Hallows is getting to see the other side of Dumbledore. In the other six books, he's basically presented as this massive force for good, who would never make dubious decisions or do the wrong thing or endanger his students. But here? Here we see that Dumbledore operated in the grey areas of morality as much as anyone. Which is one of those interesting things that comes with age - realising that your teachers and your heroes aren't infallible. They're human. 18/3/2013There are literally no words for how much I adore this book. It takes a lot in a book to make me cry (almost nothing, however, when it comes to movies and TV shows...), and yet Deathly Hallows reduces me to a weeping mess every time I read it. That said, the epilogue grates a little more every time - it just feels slightly sloppy or a little too neat and tidy or SOMETHING.That said, I love how there are so many tendrils to the story that have been gradually developed over the previous six books, and how expertly they're all pulled together here. Neville becomes more of a BAMF with every reading, and I will never not cheer for Molly Weasley screaming ""NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH"" at Bellatrix. While I know a lot of people get all ""Harry Potter and the Prolonged Camping Trip"" about the central portion of the book, those same people likely would have been upset or annoyed if they had, as Harry yells at Ron, been finding a Horcrux a week and home safe and sound by Christmas. Besides, the prolonged camping trip leads to what is arguably my favourite moment in the entire series - Ron destroying the locket, then breaking down in tears, and Harry saying ""She's like my sister. I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew."" It's such a simple moment, such a small thing. But for me, it says so much about Ron, about Harry, and about the honesty that underpins their friendship. In summary, twenty years from now, people will say to me ""After all this time?"". And my reply will be ""Always.""","Jun 20, 2011"

  “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”
I want to make this final review about 
  Neville Longbottom
Let me explain why. A couple years ago, I had a very disturbing conversation with a Potterhead friend.Crazy friend of mine: ""Did you know that Neville Longbottom was actually the real hero in Harry Potter's book?""Me: ""WTF ?! O_o""This sounding more and more crazy friend of mine: ""Yes, I read a theory that says that JK Rowling wrote this book to make us think that Harry was the hero, but in the end you realize that it has been Neville all along""After laughing at him and calling him crazy I went back to my business. But this idea stayed in my head for several days. I called all my Harry Potter's fan friends in the middle of the night and they all told me that this was nonsense and that I should go back to sleep.But this wasn't enough to get this theory out of my head, therefore, I decided back then to do a Potter-movies-athlon (I always need a good excuse). And I started to understand what he meant. Then I re-read all the books and I thought I needed Internet to help me understand better.I found an awesome article online which made me realize that might be right (you can check it here if you want), but basically it all starts with Sybill Trelawney's first prophecy that you can find below: 
  ""The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...""
During the prophecy, Trelawney specified that the requirements for the boy of the prophecy who was capable of (but not necessary would) defeating the Dark Lord are the followings:- Male,- Born in the closing days of July of 1980,- His parents had defied Voldemort three times and lived to tell about it,- He would have a power that Voldemort was unable or unwilling to comprehend.And of course, the book being called Harry Potter, and him meeting all the requirements, we all assumed it refers to our Harry, but Neville Longbottom also meets all the requirements: he was born on 30 July, 1980, his parents Frank and Alice Longbottoms, are Aurors who had directly defied Voldemort on three separate occasions. However, on the contrary of James and Lilly Potter, Neville parent's are still alive, they were tortured into insanity with the Cruciatus Curse by a group of Death Eaters and were placed at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.Moreover, Neville proved himself by standing up to Voldemort and destroying his last Horcrux, Nagini. Harry couldn't have defeated Voldemort without Neville's action in the first place.
  “We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?”
The second point that we can make us think that Neville is the true hero is the following idea, based on the fact that Harry Potter's generation is modeled on James Potter's. You can see it follows the same pattern with the following points:- Harry is like James, a leader of the group- Ron is like Sirus, a faithful friend- Hermione like Remus is really smart, a little bit outcast at first but then fully part of the group- And then Neville is Peter Pettigrew. Everyone is making fun of him. Clumsy and chubby.(- According to that theory, Ginny Weasley is Lilly Potter)But this is where the story change. Neville is loyal to Harry where Peter has been a coward. He stands by Harry no matter what, even when Voldemort asked him to join his side. This theory says that JKR wanted to show that only one ""side character"" changes the whole story. Instead of darkness and terror, Neville is the one who kills the last Horcrux (Nagini) and allowing Harry to defeat Voldemort. Instead of joining him and betraying his friends, instead of choosing the easy path, life above all moral, he chooses to be faithful.
  “It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.”
Just think about it, if Neville would have acted like Peter did, the ending would have been probably the opposite.We clearly see how his character grow during those 7 books/8 films. I personally find this theory very convincing, I'm eager to read your opinion on it!","Mar 26, 2014"

I admit, I love the different tone to this book compared to the previous novels. Harry and co. are very isolated for a lot of the novel, only returning to their beloved Hogwarts at the end. With the new Fantastic Bewst novels, Dumbledores backstory also finds a new interesting spin. I do find that the search for the Horcruxes is a little bit too easy, but I can overlook this for the wonderful way the series is concluded.Returning to these books has felt a little like revisiting an old friend. There's something so deliciously comforting about these characters, that they never fail to envelope me in warmth.","Jul 07, 2012"
"9780545010221","8850418","Edward Lorn","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn","3.5 StarsGenerally, I'm not a big fan of continuous-storyline series, and the Harry Potter series is a good example of why. I'm too much of a completionist, too OCD for this shit. Even though I rated most of these books below three stars, I felt compelled to finish them because I started them. Even after it took me six months to read GOBLET OF FIRE, I pressed forward. Even though I one-starred ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, I continued on. I had to know why people love these books as much as they do. At least I got my answer.J.K. Rowling did one major thing right with this series. Her writing matured along with her readers. As Potter got older and wiser, so did Rowling's style. This helped her quite a bit because the first three novels are horribly formulaic. But how many middle-grade kids are going to dissect overused plot points and cliched story structure? Not many. And by the time her audience was old enough to start questioning the borrowed ideas and storylines, Rowling had already established her characters and readied her pawns for battle. Had the series maintained the goofy middle-grade tone throughout, it would have likely failed. Had the first three books been as dark as the final four, the series wouldn't have seen half the success it did. In the end, it became a phenomenon because it spoke to the proper age groups at the proper times.I give this series a lot of grief, but not even my cynical ass can ignore Rowling's accomplishments. After writing this series, she went from homeless mother to one of the richest people on the face of the planet. Good for her. But I think her greatest success was getting kids reading again. And while I do not fan flail over these books, I do understand the draw. I understand the nostalgia and fond memories they invoke in their readers. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS was a little heavy in the middle. Its belly meandered and dragged some, but I was never bored to the point I was with PHOENIX. Then again, I think a lot of what I enjoyed about this book stemmed from the knowledge that I was reading the last one in the series. That thought alone made me smile and was a big reason I didn't want to put the book down.I'm glad Neville got his time in the sun, but Snape's story arc was my favorite of the bunch. Luna was another one I liked. Harry didn't really shine for me until book six, and I fucking loathed everything about Ron. I wanted Hermione and Draco to end up together, as they seemed hellbent for each other, but maybe that was just me reading too much into their hatred of one another. I kept expecting Harry to catch them rage fucking in a closet between classes.Finally, I'm pretty sure Peeves and Trelawney were screwing each other every time they were able. Next time you reread this, see if you can catch why I say that. The scene I remember the best out of the entire series is the underwater stuff in GOBLET. In summation: Six easy reads and one big pile of shit equal a series that owes a lot to young readers and nostalgia. Books six and seven are clearly the best of the bunch. If I had to rate the series as a whole, I'd have to give it three stars. Final Judgment: Done at last. Done at last. Thank Tom Cruise almighty I'm done at last!A rundown of my ratings for each book:The Sorcerer's Stone ***The Chamber of Secrets ***The Prisoner of Azkaban **The Goblet of Fire **** (Wow... I don't remember liking this one enough to give it 4 stars... Odd.)The Order of the Phoenix * (I want to give this book zero stars, or, preferably, a minus 3)The Half-Blood Prince ****The Deathly Hallows ***1/2","Nov 17, 2014"

They're the same things that bothered me the first time I read it, but the final confrontation and brilliant revelations and reversals of certain characters wiped them from my memory back then. Now the second time, I find that these reasons linger. 1. So many deaths. Right from the beginning, starting with (view spoiler)[Hedwig (hide spoiler)]. Somehow that really got to me this time!2. So much speculation about Dumbledore and his true motivations and shortcomings. I do like how this was resolved in the end, but didn't enjoy the maligning of Dumbledore, or Harry's doubts about him.3. So much time spent with only Harry, Ron and Hermione running around the forest. I miss their interactions with other characters and the wizarding world.4. No Hogwarts until 75%. This is kind of the same as the previous point except that Hogwarts simply deserves its own line. I've realized that the setting is a huge part of my enjoyment of this series, and I was impatient with the book until the story returned there. I missed all of the extra characters - teachers, ghosts, portrait-dwellers, fellow students - as well as the magic of the castle itself.I still love the series. There's nothing else like it. It's darker than I would have liked, even knowing where it was going the second time around, but like I said, I just wanted to live at Hogwarts and not watch the whole world being destroyed, along with so many people that Harry could possibly consider family. The ending is really great. It's one of those endings that is actually epic, and some of the minor characters have great moments in the battle at Hogwarts. But I found this finale bitter enough that I might avoid any future re-reads and stick to the earlier books for the nostalgia of simply hanging out at Hogwarts.","Apr 25, 2017"

I feel as though I have returned from a great journey. A journey that’s only begun. I finished the last book this morning and yet I feel I don’t know the whole story yet. I know there are people who make a hobby, an obsession, maybe even a career about Harry Potter lore and now I can understand why. This is not a story, it’s an experience. This is the masterpiece of a truly gifted author who understands what it means to be a great storyteller. Rowling understands that it’s not enough to throw action and plot at a reader, but to draw them, gently and unobtrusively, into a new, believable world. Her world doesn’t play by the rules of ours, but no matter. From the first chapter of book one, we are taken under Rowling’s cloak of invisibility as an ordinary human and she doesn’t insult our intelligence nor write down to us. She gains our trust, word by word, tale by tale. She gives us rich background, complex characters, deep emotion. At every page, we find something we relate to—whether an action or a feeling. Until we are under the spell and our trust in her is absolute. Like Dumbledore’s Army follows Harry, we are willing to follow wherever Rowling leads. Because we believe in her world.There are things I don’t fully understand. Things I want to explore further. And this is why the ending is only the beginning. It’s like reaching the last level of a difficult video game, winning the prize, and now the game is open for “free play.” You can go explore to your heart’s content without peril.And I will.After all this time.Always.","Feb 29, 2016"

"9780545010221","4255477","Angela","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4255477-angela","I'll be honest, when I went to the midnight release for this book and was waiting in line to purchase it, it made me so incredibly happy to open the book and realize there wasn't a blurb in the front cover-flap. Instead there was this:       The        dedication           of this book       is split    seven ways:to Neil,    to Jessica,        to David,            to Kenzie,                   to Di,               to Anne,            and to you,       if you have         stuck             with Harry                  until the                 very               end.It made me so incredibly happy. I had dreaded this book, and anticipated it like no other. And to open to where the blur normally is and see, instead, a dedication made me relieved. There would be no chance of me spoiling even the smallest instance of this book for myself; I would read it as it was intended.I don't want to say too much about the book itself, because - well - spoilers. Even now, years later, it's hard for me to speak about the plot, about the things that happened, if I'm not absolutely sure that the people I'm talking with have read it.I remember there being some complaints about certain aspects of this story dragging a bit - you know what I'm talking about - but I actually feel like it flowed beautifully well. There were very few down moments, very few moments where we were allowed to catch our breath while Harry learned what he needed to know, figured out the mysteries and the puzzles left, and determined how best to accomplish them.The first time I read it, and every time since (this is only my second re-read), I was rapt with attention. Not bored for a moment.I said in my review for Half-Blood Prince that it was probably the most satisfying book to re-read after having finished the series. This is the second most satisfying. I will readily admit that there are some very detailed machinations that occur in Deathly Hallows, and - at first - it can be a bit confusing while you try to catch up to the revelations. But they're clear as day on the re-read, when you, again, catch the little hints, moments, and details that lead to those revelations. J.K. Rowling is as on-form here as she ever was, probably more so.After the losses and emotions of Order of the Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince, I wasn't sure that my emotions could take anymore. But they did. And it just might have been the most heart-wrenching moment I've experienced in this series yet. My heart was ripped out several times over, twisted and stabbed, and then put - painfully - back into my chest.This series means something incredibly special to me. I can't even fully articulate it. It just is. I've loved it from the beginning. I love it still.After all this time?Always.Previous thoughts:This book.This series.J.K. Rowling is amazing. The absolute genius of the world, the characters, the story blows my mind.If I have any complaint it's only that I want more. (view spoiler)[My one complaint is really that I wish the Slytherins had taken a more prominent role in the battle against Voldemort. (hide spoiler)]This is the first time I've re-read this book since immediately after its release. In fact this series re-read is my first since Deathly Hallows came out. In many ways it was like a first read all over again. There were so many small details, so many little things that make the world and the characters that I'd forgotten. I admit to being slightly worried that somewhere along the way this series wouldn't live up to the incredible love I have for it. It holds such a special place in my heart and I didn't want to ruin that. But as I continued and read further and kept going, those fears were quickly avada kedavra'd. I love this series even more now than I did the first time. Funnily enough, even though I wasn't a child when I started the Harry Potter series I learned that there was a lot that I didn't fully appreciate when I read it way back when. Things that I can only truly appreciate now that I'm an adult and can look back.That's the genius of Rowling; that she creates a world and story that's enthralling to children, teenagers, and just as beautiful and entrancing to adults. The magic of these books touches my soul.","Apr 06, 2013"
"9780545010221","24781351","Chiara","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24781351-chiara","Ho finalmente deciso di rompere il silenzio stampa sulla saga Harry Potter, e lo faccio perché infastidita da un accanimento che trovo abbastanza ridicolo, sia dalla parte di chi quest'opera la vuole boicottare, sia da quella che invece la vuole osannare.Premetto che questo è un commento da attribuire a ben sette libri e non soltanto ad uno, per cui è molto probabile che quello che scrivo riguardi solo passaggi particolari o non rifletta a pieno ciò che penso di un particolare volume.Detto questo... ho notato che sembra di gran moda ultimamente (e inspiegabilmente: voglio dire, sono passati anni dalla pubblicazione dell'ultimo volume eh, posso capire lo scoppio ritardato, ma a volte si esagera) denigrare una delle saghe letterarie che ha avuto più successo e fama a livello planetario e storico. Che possa piacere o non piacere, rimane insindacabilmente un parere personale, libero, soggettivo e indiscutibile. Però ho letto molto frequentemente, negli ultimi tempi, attacchi alla saga di Harry Potter come se questa fosse colpevole della decadenza letteraria del nuovo millennio, o dell'imbarbarimento culturale dell'intera umanità, o che so, dell'ingiustificabile demerito di aver abissato opere migliori ma, ahimè, meno visibili e popolari.Io non voglio dire assolutamente che i sette romanzi della Rowling siano esenti da imprecisioni; ""si poteva fare meglio"" vale praticamente per qualsiasi cosa nell'universo, e di sicuro vale a maggior ragione per quelli che sono probabilmente tra i libri più famosi e popolari di sempre. E tuttavia stare a sottolineare gli errori, le forzature, i difetti, le cose-che-semplicemente-non-tornano, le macchinazioni di quella che alla fin fine è pur sempre una saga per ragazzi, mi sembra un tantino pretenzioso e a tratti ridicolo.Che ci siano opere in circolazione che ""avrebbero meritato di stare al posto di Harry Potter"" (per i motivi che volete) è un ritornello che ormai sento ovunque, e tuttavia non posso che chiedermi: non si può evitare una classifica? Se qualcuno mi chiede un parere su Harry Potter, non posso che rispondere che la sua storia mi è piaciuta molto, che lo trovo un simbolo della crescita dei ragazzi degli anni Novanta, e che conservo il ricordo di quando mi emozionavo per l'uscita del nuovo volume con estrema dolcezza. Questo vuol dire che non è vero forse che ci sono opere migliori? Ma chi l'ha detto. Mica mi metto a pensare male di qualcosa che ho letto solo perché poi ne leggo un'altra che mi è piaciuta... Mi sono piaciute tutte e due.Ho letto nella mia vita molte cose scritte meglio di Harry Potter, molte storie più appassionanti, molte cose più ""molto""; eppure fa parte di me, e quando penso all'opera lo faccio con una tenerezza che mi stupisce tuttora. Per quanto riguarda le ""forzature"" tanto additate, non posso che dire che alcune le condivido, altre semplicemente non le ho notate. Tuttavia (e questo è vero per tantissimi libri che ho letto), io non costruisco il mio indice di gradimento soltanto su questo: voglio dire, la letteratura non è un'equazione, e se leggo lo faccio per svariati motivi, ma di certo non per trovare certezze scientifico-matematiche che devono portarmi alla soluzione di una differenziale di secondo ordine. In alcuni casi, ci sono sbavature inammissibili, d'accordo, ma semplicemente non credo che Harry Potter rientri in questa casistica (parere personale).La cosa che probabilmente mi rende così attaccata alla saga è la trattazione del tema dell'amicizia. Quindi no, non mi interessa se la storia della mappa del Malandrino sia un po' una trovata per far quadrare i conti, o se Voldemort sia un po' troppo caricaturale, o che il finale con gli Horcrux poteva essere pensato meglio. Quando leggi di Ron, Hermione e Harry e stai crescendo, questa storia ti lascia un segno indelebile, e di storie così purtroppo ce ne sono poche. Se penso a tutta la commozione genuina e sincera, alle lacrime e i sorrisi che questi sette libri mi hanno regalato, penso anche che il mio pensiero sull'amicizia, il valore che le attribuisco, l'ideale che ne costruisco, nascono anche su queste pagine. Quando penso alla storia di Neville, che si è costruito il coraggio sulle orme dei pochi compagni che gli hanno dato fiducia ed è riuscito a sbocciare, a Luna, ha trovato il suo posto nel mondo grazie all'affetto e nonostante le sue stranezze, alla storia di Lunastorta, Codaliscia, Felpato e Ramoso... Beh... non mi trattengo. L'altalenante inimicizia tra Draco e Harry, poi, la trovo semplicemente meravigliosa (forse è per questo che se penso a quello scempio della Maledizione dell'erede vado proprio in bestia, anzi no, è senz'altro per questo).Harry Potter è forse, insieme a poche altre cose come One Piece, ad esempio, un caso di rara bellezza in cui l'amicizia riesce a trionfare su tutto, anche e soprattutto sull'amore, ed è per questo motivo che sarà sempre con me, indelebile, eterno, ed apprezzato compagno di vita.","Oct 08, 2015"

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows broke me. I CAN'T DEAL WITH THE DEATHS OF MY FAVOURITE CHARACTERS. . . This ""review"" isn't going to be a review at all, it's more of a Snape appreciation post. If you don't like him, please see yourself out right about now.Severus Snape is my favourite character of all time. He is such a complex and interesting character, so obbbbviously The Prince's Tale is my favourite chapter.I loved Snape even before the big reveal in the last book. He is very clever and sly, and I just love his sarcasm and his bitterness about the world.Snape isn't the dictionary definition of either ""good"" or ""bad"". He's in the grey area between those two polar opposites. His character taught me that it's human to make mistakes and be imperfect.

It had its moments when it was slow paced, but other times it was all happening very fast (not in a bad way). This wasn't my favorite book of the whole series, but i still thought it was well written. My favorite scene was the battle at Hogwarts. It was as if i was physically there watching the events unfold until it reached the climax. I know i will have to revisit the series again someday due to all the minor details I could've missed. I will forever be thankful to J.K. Rowling for creating this iconic world and for entertaining millions of people. I find it fascinating how one person can come up with so much content and make an incredible story. If i had the chance to visit any fictional place, my answer would be Hogwarts.","Nov 23, 2016"

"9780545010221","1178739","Mephistia","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1178739-mephistia","I was stunned and dismayed by the time I finished this book. I have been a fan of the HP series since about 2000, when a friend recommended Book 1 to me as a cute little book that she was tutoring 5th graders with. I read it, liked it, and figured I'd pick up the next book when it came out.As each book came out, many critics and fans commented that JK had a unique style of approaching her series; the way that her books grew with her targeted audience. The series became darker and more complex, the writing more intense as the series continued.By the 5th book, I was well and truly hooked, and read each book voraciously when it came out. I re-read the entire available series just before the next book was released, and enjoyed them immensely.When Book 7 came out, I was disappointed, but only in the way that a fan is when what they have enjoyed so long is at an end. There would be no more HP books to look forward to. As I had not been part of HP online communities, nor did I enjoy the movies, this was the end of the series for me.Then I read the book, and I was furious. Six books she spent preaching about house unity, and how Hogwarts must unite or fall. Six books she spent warning of a terrible and devastating war that Harry would be in the thick of. Six books that were well enough written between plot and description that I could overlook her lack of characterization for antagonists or the fact that Ginny was essentially a flat character. And then book 7, where she completely ignores everything she spent 6 books setting up, skips around the reality of war by having Harry wander around lost on the moors for a bit, and then pulls a religious analogy out of her hat. Although the religious analogy did make me laugh -- I can't help but wonder if all those who said HP was the devil's work will be praising it like it's Narnia in 10 years.Still, I couldn't believe what she'd done to her work. I don't know if that honestly was her vision from the beginning, as she claims -- if it was, then the entire series suffers for it, and her vision is severely limited. The other alternative is that she sold out or simply didn't care because she's already richer than a queen. Whatever the reasoning, it was an awful, disappointing end to a beautifully textured series.---EDITED TO ADD---I still dislike book 7, although I love the rest of the series. I love how JK structured the books, right? I mean, she's a genius with the foreshadowing and with dropping in information about the characters backgrounds without being heavy handed. She's just a brilliant writer who structured these very rich, well-crafted worlds that hold up to multiple re-readings. I love how the books ""grow"" with the reader, with the first books being written for a younger reader and the later books being written for an older reader. Most of all, I love how she foreshadows across the books, so things that happen in, say, Book 5 are foreshadowed in Books 1 and 2. It's AMAZING. She's so incredibly talented, and it makes reading her books a real treat. Which was why I am still so incredibly upset at reading book 7. See, in Book 7, she brings up this whole notion of those three items (the Elder Wand, Invisibility Cloak, and Philosophers Stone) being tied together by the myth of the three brothers. That's the part that pissed me off. It felt ... cobbled in. Pulled out of a hat, last minute. Like, JK had told us about the numberless clock in the Weasley's house warning us about danger, about hunting for garden gnomes, about the time Ron's teddy bear got turned into a spider ... but she didn't mention this apparently incredibly common wizarding childrens story? She talks about all these daily aspects of wizarding life on a regular basis, introduced through Ron's family, but never once -- never once in 6 entire books does Ron or Ginny or anyone even let out a breath of a whisper about this apparently common wizarding fable? Think about how often you reference common fairy stories and fables in your life. Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Big Bad Wold, etc. So if JK Rowling actually had this idea of a wizarding fable/myth as a major plot in her overarching series, I think she would have woven it in as foreshadowing much more effectively. What I think happened is this:Right around the time Book 7 was being written, all these internet/ social media/ fanboard sites were really taking off. They weren't huge before then, but they were really taking off as she'd released Books 5 & 6 and was writing book 7. I think that the fans had pretty much figured out what was happening, plot wise -- which is a mark of what a great writer JK Rowling is -- and JK felt bad about that -- which is a natural creative response.I think her publisher advised her to keep quiet about reading the fanboards for legal reasons, which she wisely did, but I fully believe she read them, and that she wasn't happy about two things:(1) The proliferation of fanfic and noncanon fanfic pairings(2) How thoroughly the fans had guessed the key points of the plot (particularly what would be happening with Snape and Dumbledore and the Horcruxes).So I think that JK just sort of pulled that bit about the 3 Wizarding brothers and the ancient fairy tale and 3 legendary items out of her hat (with no foreshadowing regarding this plotline in the previous 6 books) because she wanted to surprise her fans with a sort of ""gotcha""/ surprise moment. Furthermore, I suspect she wrote in the epilogue as a sort of middle finger to the proliferation of fanfic writers, as though to say, ""And by the way, no. That is not how it happens. Harry and Hermoine do not end up together. Harry and Draco do not end up together. Ron and Pansy do not end up together. These people end up together, in these pairs. I do so decree it, and thus it shall be.""So that's why I don't like Book: 7. I feel like it's less true to the ethos of the series than the rest of the books. I feel like JK Rowling kind of strayed from herself as a writer ... that she reacted (poorly) to her fans, and that it reflects badly on her work. I can't really enjoy reading the book even now. It feels out of step with the rest of the series.I've mostly moved on. I've forgiven her (even if the insult is imagined). She's a truly talented writer and generous and compassionate woman. She's an inspiration to me, as a writer. And it was a weird time in fandom and for the internet, when that book was being written. Everyone makes mistakes. I think JK has more than made up for the upset of book 7, though -- she wrote 6 other amazing books, she's gracious and considerate in the fandom community, and she's a principled and compassionate woman. A true role model. What's one book in comparison to the rest of her legacy?","Nov 26, 2008"

Because so much happens in this book I think I will shorten the review by only talking about the things I really want to talk about and keeping it kind of short. First off the Dursley's are going into hiding. I sometimes wonder if Mr. Dursley has any sense because he says we are leaving then nope we aren't. Dudley was like screw it dad I want to leave. Petunia just wants Dudley to be safe and at the end they did leave Private Drive. Dudley's last words to Harry was I didn't think you were a waste of space or something along those lines. I keep forgetting that. Harry leaves Private Drive with the Order and of course they had a master plan that they would turn 6 people into Harry as they escaped into safe houses. Each one different. Harry rode with Hagrid which is very emotional because Hagrid is the one to bring Harry there and he is the one taking him away. The twins, Ron, Hermione, Fluer, and Mundungus turn into Harry and they are off into the night to the different safe houses. Apparently the Death Eaters knew that they were traveling that night which we later learned how and why they knew. Hedwig dies which is extremely sad and Hagrid fell from the sky trying to protect Harry. The first time I read it I though Hagrid was dead but he is alive and well and I am glad Hagrid is okay. They arrive at Tonk's house and then take a porkey to the Burrow. Bill and Fluer's wedding take place in the Burrow and during the wedding the Death Eaters took over the ministry. Hermione disapperates with Ron and Harry into the city where they are met by Death Eaters. I don't think it was ever com firmed whether or not Harry still had the trace on him. They spent the night in Grimmauld place and later learned Kreacher's story. We figure out that R.A.B is Regulus Black and he allowed Voldemort to use Kreacher to drink the potion to hide his Horcrux. Regulas of course with the help of Kreacher goes to the cave and drinks the potion and tells Kreacher to destroy it before dying. It was honestly a heartbreaking moment. Regulus unlike Sirius treated Kreacher with more respect and Kreacher does love Regulus more. Harry gives Kreacher the fake Horcrux and Kreacher looses it and after that treats Harry, Ron, and Hermione more kindly. He also find Mundungus and they discover that he sold the locket to Umbridge. I am pretty sure when everyone read that part for the first time they are all, including me, this lady again? I thought she was gone. With careful planning and with the help of polyjuice potion the three of them manage to get into the ministry and find the locket but like Kreacher, could not destroy it. Later on Ron will stab it with the word of Gryffindor. Speaking of the sword, Neville proves himself as a worthy Griffindor as he mamages to pull the sword out of the hat just like Harry. Neville I feel like thought he didn't belong in this hout but he proved he is brave and courageous. Not being able to return to Sirius's house they start camping out in the woods, Ron leaves but comes back Harry ignore's Ron's warning and says Voldemort's name and they get captured. Hermione is tortured and honestly that scene was very scary because Bellatrix is cruel and I didn't know the first time I read it whether or not Hermione survived. She does and recovers in shell cottage where Bill and Fluer now live. Dobby rescues the trio plus a few others including Luna and Dobby dies in the process. It is a sad moment and even Harry is so devastated that he had trouble saying anything but Goodbye at Dobby's funeral. Way before that when the met Bathilda and learned she was actually a snake Hermione breaks Harry's wand. Harry feels like a part of him is missing. Told by Ollivander his wand is repairable he later tries to fix it with the elder wand and it works. At shell cottage they made an agreement with Griphook the goblin and pulled off an epic break in into Gringotts. I loved that part and it was my favourite moment in this book. The battle of Hogwarts was more sad and more epic this time I read it. Grawp threw Hagrid through the window so he could join the fight. I really wished we could of seen that scene in the movie. Percy comes back and learns his lesson that family is very important and he witnessed his brother die. Honestly it was heartbreaking to see Percy, who finally wanted to see and hep his family again only to lose one of them. I mean I cried reading that part too.Lets not forget at the end that the house elves lead by Kreacher also helped fight. And Mrs. Weasley fighting Bellatrix was insane. Bellatrix almost killed Ginny and Mrs. Weasley was mad. I don't think I ever saw her that mad ever. People tried to help her but she reused any help and they all stared to watch. I feel like everyone stopped fighting or were half fighting but watching them fight.That's it for now and I probably add more later because I still have a lot to say.","Nov 06, 2014"

Also it dragged on forever... I felt I was reading it for way too long. But I sound way too negative right now, I still love it, I just wish some things were done differently. - The part of the trio being on the run was extremely over stretched and plain boring. It felt as because they were not at Hogwarts anymore and had no classes to go to, or homework to do, well they didn't know what to do with themselves. Also while all of them were good and quite brilliant while at school, on the run they seemed rather dim witted. - The fact that it was so incredibly hard for them to believe in Deathly Hallows was stupid. Wizards, goblins, unicorns, souls splitting.... all the magical stuff and they cannot believe in something just as magical?! Say what ?! - I have been liking Fleur for a while (ever since she appeared basically) but this book solidified my liking for her character. She seemed real, composed and an excellent image of a great wife. - Remus Lupin is forever my favorite character of the whole series. And while it was hard to read the part where Harry yelled at him for wanting to leave Tonks, I think that it was a great point of Rowling's saying that adults should listen to children more often, because sometimes they know what's best better than adults with all of their life experience do. - Reading second time around I have to agree with Ron. Dumbledore was quite mental. The book should have been named Dumbledore's games or something... I enjoyed Aberforth though, little that we got of him. - At the final battle of Hogwarts when house-elves joined the battle, what was up with them poking enemies with their kitchen knives??? They are house elves, they have strong magic on their own! But the best they could do is poke with knives?... what? - Voldemort is even more of a coward second time reading. - The whole book to me seemed stretched and drawn out, but I did enjoy the beginning a lot. The wedding part was very interesting. Also all of the lore on Dumbledore's and Riddle's young lives was great. And obviously Snape's (sob, sob, sob).- The epilogue, ehhh. I feel like a lot of important characters were left out of it. The whole series had such an extensive character count, and all of them were built exceptionally well. Leaving them out seemed a little like taking the chocolate chips out of chocolate chip cookies. I would much rather read about what George was doing, how were Bill and Fleur , where was Luna... than to see what cliche of names Harry + Ginny and Ron + Hermione named their kids.... That was just so unrealistic! - While I loved Ginny's character in all other books, she didn't have much page time in this book and thus was pretty blah.My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG","Jan 31, 2017"

It was that feverish feeling you get when you're so wrapped up in a story. It's the absolute love you have for the characters, and the spectacular world-building that stretches your imagination.

As Rowling turns her universe upside-down and reveals the past of a man who is fully accepted as the greatest wizard of all time, she reveals a character depth beyond belief. Dumbledore is made out to be a sinner, a villain, a God-like figure who does not stand in the way for an innocent sacrifice. He is good, but he is focused on the greater good, sacrificing individuals in order to achieve his goal. He loves Harry, heart and soul, but he still needs him dead. And worst of all? He has coldblodily known it all the time. While people has celebrated Snape's surprising sacrifice, I will always celebrate Dumbledore's betrayal. Purity and peace doesn't come without a price, and Dumbledore is willing to pay. He is a brilliant exception in Rowling's black-and-white universe. (view spoiler)[Along with Harry Potter of course. The part of Voldemort that lives in him reminds us that no one is pure. That we all hold a bit of evil – even though it has been attached to us by accidental spells and curses. (hide spoiler)]One thing that has been clear to me on rereading these books, is how black-and-white Rowling usually operates. Like the sorting hat, she conveniently divides her characters into good and evil and very few outsteps this path. I have always found it cowardly, how this book dismisses Slytherin-pupils for instance. An entire house of people, thrown out of the defining battle because they happen to be wearing green and silver. Rowling spends the entire series preaching how Slytherin isn't necessarily defined by evil – and yet, she chooses to dismiss them, when the fight is about to come. I've always hated it. I have always hated how the Slytherins in the end only seem to be allowed a single character trait. This time around, I also had a bit of trouble grasping the scope of Voldemort's evil. Is he about to destroy the universe? Will his rise to power mean the end of muggle-life? And if so, will it mean the end of every muggle in the world, or is his power restricted to Britain only? Why does the world not send help to fight him – why does the Order not include African, American or even European wizards? Voldemort's power and evil seems unlimited, and yet he is fought by an underground army consisting of Britains only, fighting the ultimate battle at a schoolground. I am confused by the perspective; Voldemort could rule the world, crush every offender – and yet he is at Hogwarts, fighting children. The suspense is however undeniable. We don't have time for so many strategic questions while reading this book, because it is nerve-wracking to read. Rowling makes you forget time and space – and even plot holes – as she drags you along for break-in's, wandlore, secret missions and treasure hunts for pieces of an evil soul.I have always loved the horcruxes and the psychological insight they provide into both Harry and Voldemort's soul. Little by little, you become fascinated with Voldemort's anger and his desire to be accepted, and you even come to understand the darkest corners of Harry's soul. While the treasure hunt itself is a bit tedious at times, its ultimate goal is breathtaking. However, as much as I've always loved the horcruxes, I've always hated the Deathly Hallows. It's puzzling why no one has ever mention Beedle the Bard earlier, as his tales are supposed to be the mythic pillars of the wizarding world. Why has Hermione, who has read about every book of wizardry, never stumbled upon these ancient tales – and why has Ron, who has grown up with these stories and loved them forever, never mentioned them? Why isn't there a magic frog card with Beedle the Bard? Why has Rowling never let a bit of the enthralling tales slip earlier? It's all so sudden. And to me, it's a bit implausible. As is wandlore itself.Wandlore is mythical, wonderful to read about, and impossible to understand. I'm still not sure about the whole allegiance thing; how exactly a wand's power is transferred or why. It's messy and I'd have loved a bit more explanation.But of course, I'd loved a bit more of everything. I love this book – mostly because of Dumbledore's character development (even beyond his death), and because it is so actionpacked and gratifying. Seven books, read in the dark with a galloping heart, and then this wonderful ending, where only a few characters are spared, and all are forever marked. This book may be filled with errors, but I am willing to overlook them. It is hard not to as these wonderful characters has been part of my life for so long.The Harry Potter-books are magical. And magic is hard to define. (view spoiler)[ A final note: I hate the ending relationships. This is perhaps more related to book six than book seven, but I've never understood Ginny and Harry. We get no explanation, no gradual falling-in-love process; suddenly Harry is in love with Ginny, while one moment earlier he wasn't. There was so much potential; so many scenes at the Burrow, Rowling could have used in order to build these feelings. Instead Harry falls in love out of jealousy.And then there's Ron and Hermione – another relationship enabled by hurt and jealousy. I can understand why Ron loves Hermione, but I can't understand why she loves him. He has been mean to her, ridiculing her, never appreciated her and even hinted she was ugly on several occasions. Would you fall in love with someone, who asked you out as a last resort, and loudly exclaimed that no one else wanted to go out with you? Would you fall in love with someone who got angry on the same occasion, because you actually went with someone else? Someone who ignored you, because he didn't appreciate you enough to ask? Someone who created an entire relationship with another girl, because he was jealous of a relationship you had before he had even shown interest in you? I think not. Ron is a lovely person, but he never treated Hermione well. At least not in my opinion. (hide spoiler)]","Aug 20, 2016"
"9780545010221","6313408","Jonathan Terrington","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6313408-jonathan-terrington","As a whole series, my average rating for the series ends up roughly around 4 stars. This is purely because once the series gets over its initial roughness, keeping the charm and developing the characters it becomes a very solid and imaginative series. It may not be the 'epic' that some people are looking for in their fantasy - but like The Chronicles of Narnia its a quirky and appealing little series. Let's be honest: nothing I say or do not say about this series will persuade or dissuade anyone from reading these books if they put their mind to either standpoint. All I can say is how I found the novels and with all honesty I found that they improved so much that I think I will actually miss not having another book in the series to move on and read. I'm a huge reader of fantasy and have been since my mother read The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe to me as a six year old child (I went on to read the novel for myself the following year). There's something about the way a truly great fantasy novel can take you to a whole other world (same with sci-fi) and yet remind you about real world concepts, themes, emotions and values that is appealing. So, I admit that when other children grew up on Harry Potter, I grew up on the novels which preceded Harry Potter. I grew up in Narnia, Middle Earth, Wonderland, Neverland and so on. So as I saw the hype for the Harry Potter series (coupled with the fact that my parents thought the books a touch too dark for my age) I may have decided to avoid reading them, thinking that they were copycats of other, better, books. How snobbish of me.I would easily add this series (for the improvement, character building, world etc.) to my list of unique fantasy series. Of course this would be a list featuring the before mentioned books and also anything by Brandon Sanderson (particularly his Mistborn books), The Wheel of Time (if you don't mind looooong drawn out epic fantasy tales) and The Name of the Wind (as far as it has gone till now). I definitely am willing to recommend any books that you might like if you grew up on Harry Potter or anything similar. Pardon my ramblings, all I wish to say is that I was very impressed with the series after being less than so with the first two and a half books. The other four fully make the most of the promise of the first few books however and therefore create works of fiction which perform all that I believe literature should do.In the novels there are subtle and nuanced reflections on education and the influence of governments and politics on daily life. Rowling seems to imply that while government is a great thing behind the scenes to keep the world running there are times when it meddles in the greater good. Leonard Nimoy (RIP) passed away earlier and he once said (in character) that 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few'. I believe this is the concept that Rowling wished to convey about education and government. The few are in power and authority and it is their job to fulfill the needs of the many, not their own.I also love the final part of this novel with its very Christian message. In some ways Harry becomes a rough Christ figure in these novels (which has lead to the book's fair share of criticism such as how can you mix a message of faith with magic etc.) with how his love and sacrifice for his friends enables him to be able to defeat dark magic. It's a similar theme to that used in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe but in a different way and I loved how it was used here. I was often told that the books were so non-Christian with the magic and everything but this conclusion is very Christian in how it conveys that evil is created through fear and a desire to become like God (all-powerful like Voldemort attempts to become) and that only sacrificial love can truly defeat the curse of evil. It's a great message and I would definitely not hide these books or ban them, I would encourage children to read them and then ask them questions about those themes!All in all, I definitely enjoyed the books and have also been enjoying the movies simultaneously. I wish in some senses that I had read them sooner and definitely recommend them for the story. Don't be sucked in by the hype, but do read them for their beautiful little story and thematic expression!","Feb 24, 2015"

Granted I wasn't in middle school or being read to before bed: nope I was 21 years old and enjoyed them just as much if maybe not more for waiting. I know this has been said plenty of times before me, but JK Rowling created a legacy for herself with writing these books. The first four were so wonderful and even though the next 3 books (plot-wise) went downhill for me, this ending had me smiling and reminded me why these books are so much more than children's tales. There are so many great moments throughout this series and these characters are some I am never going to find and love in other books as much as I do in these books. Hagrid always remained a favorite, along with Ron Weasley and of course Dumbledore!! The boarding of the scarlet train to Hogwarts scenes were another magical yet simply beautiful piece to the story. HEDWIG!! Hermonine and the house elves, Christmas at Hogwarts, Hagrid's dragon Norbert, and the wise and wonderful words of Dumbledore about love for each other.

Throughout reading these books i continued to ask myself “why did you not read these books earlier?” but now i am actually happy i waited till now at a time in my life when i can truly understand everything that Harry goes through and pick up on the lessons that you learn throughout. Such a gripping and empowering book that i will probably cherish forever.I think with being her last book, J.K Rowlings writing flourishes here. It still has everything we expect from her, the comradery, love, adventure and humour, but with so much more feeling to it, that in just the way she wrote out certain moments could change my mood. It was incredible. I also found her writing expanding to areas she had only touched on before. Things concerning grief, power struggles and the strains of friendship that i think she worked through really well. Super impressed with the writing in this one.I can’t get over how much I loved this story. the last book ends with them planning a quest to find the Horcruxes and this is exactly what the majority of the story focuses on. It really is the be all end all kind of thing, because if they don’t find them, then all is lost, and you definitely feel that pressure on the trio throughout the book.Many parts were a bit slow and depressing when they felt they had nowhere to turn and didn’t know what to do next, but again, that despair makes it more real for the reader in understanding what they’re going through. So that didn’t bother me too much. However, there were some lovely moments that we get to see of everyone in the order together again, the Weasley family, Harry’s trip down memory lane and of course the DA members coming back a little. J.K Rowling really knows how to tug at your heartstrings and it is no different in this book!The plot is actually so encapsulating, due to it really being the end of Harry’s story and as it progresses you feel it building up and you know the defining moment is coming but you still don’t know what that will be. It’s all just so much to deal with at once and it felt overpowering towards the end of the book. It was perfect though, because i know that is exactly the way Harry feels at the time, and J.K Rowling did that on purpose so we would understand how much of a toll everything is taking on him. SOOOO many emotions guys, i can’t even begin to explain how this book made me feel.As far as “character developments” go i thought there wouldn’t really be more considering this is the seventh and final book, but this is the point in which Harry truly becomes a man and we see how different he really is from not only Voldemort but Dumbledore also. Harry really is a unique and realistic character who i have come to adore. He makes mistakes, he gets confused, he is brave but still terrified of things he has to do and i have come to appreciate it all.We get a lot of Hermione and Ron in this book, being that they are with Harry for the majority of the story on his travels and for the first time we really see a crack in their relationship, but what i love is how J.K Rowling works with this to make them all the better friends. So much love and determination from these two and they really are what makes the book all that more special.One thing i definitely wanted to talk about are the deaths. There is a lot of death in this book. Some big blows and some small but all are very significant to Harry in this battle he is fighting. I think because there is seven books and we get that time to really bond with the secondary characters that when one of them dies, it feels like someone you actually know. This book had me bawling for the last 100 pages and i just couldn’t believe what i was reading. You know someone is a great author when they can do that to you!Lastly, i just want to say how impressed i am that J.K Rowling made it possible to do her traditional end of the book info dump on us in such an extraordinary way in the “Kings Cross” place. What a cheeky author making that possible but I love her all the more for it. Love those conversations, we learn so much!Honestly, such a freaking fantastic series and it all came to a very poetic end, that personally suited me just fine. I adored the story of Harry’s crazy, daring and loving life and i feel like i am apart of it in some way, as is everyone who reads these books and goes on the adventures with Harry. Loved it.","Dec 20, 2017"

Reading all books back to back (I started the first one in October and finished the last one in January) only made it even more apparent what an incredible saga that Rowling gifted us. All the linked parts, the character development, and just how astonishing it was to see it all unfold. Somehow it still managed to leave me awed even knowing how it all ends. While my opinions of the series as a whole didn’t change (other than the fact that my favorite book is now officially Half-Blood Prince and I’ve gotten over my irritation with Dobby) there is one aspect in these stories that I paid a lot more attention to this go around: Dumbledore and Snape.First and foremost, I’m team Snape (and a Slytherin if you were curious). Yes, I am fully aware that he was a horrible shithead to a bunch of children, primarily Harry, and the only reason was because he loved Harry’s mother and she didn’t love him. Boo-hoo. I’m also aware that he was a Death Eater doing terrible things on behalf of Voldemort before he joined up with Dumbeldore. I’m aware of all these things but I can still appreciate the bravery and risks he took in the name of love, even it was misguided. It doesn’t necessarily make him a hero in my eyes and his actions don’t make up for the wrong he did, but it is still worthy of mention. Don’t agree?hahaha Kidding. But on to an even more controversial topic: Dumbledore was kind of a dick. Sure, at first he’s that kind, fatherly figure that Harry can’t help but look up to. But when year after year at Hogwarts passes and poor young Harry is dealing with shit that he can barely comprehend, does Dumbledore make it a point to educate him on the ways of the wizarding world? Nope. And when we finally realize what’s been going on this entire time? That he’s known from the very beginning that Harry was going to have to die for the “greater good”?!Sure, if he had told Harry at an early age he could have lost his marbles at the prospect of an early death so I understand why he didn’t tell him but I definitely don’t agree with it because he didn’t treat Harry like a pawn; he treated him like he was someone special to him. Think of all the times that Harry was touting Dumbledore’s greatness while from the very beginning he’s known the endgame all along.Leave an infant on a doorstep, don’t even ring the doorbell. They’ll find him in the morning. Know Harry’s living in a goddamn cupboard under the stairs, constantly abused by the Dursley’s–does nothing. Let Snape continue to mistreat him unnecessarily. Blames it on the fact he developed feelings for the reason why he’s lied to Harry his entire life… talk about emotional manipulation. Not letting Harry in on the secret of the horcruxes until after he was doomed to die because his dumbass, for personal advancement reasons, put it on because it was also a Hallow. Dick move, Dumbledore. /rantRowling really achieved greatness with this final installment. Each installment has progressively gotten darker as Harry and all other characters take step after step into adulthood. This world that Rowling has created is both horrible and mesmerizing in equal measure. A world where there are creatures that can suck out your very soul, but also wondrous creatures like unicorns and Hippogriffs. A world where you can be struck down with two simple words, but also where owls deliver your mail and paintings talk. But the most wondrous thing that Rowling accomplished with these stories is just how many lives she transformed, mine included. It’s enough to make anyone believe in magic.","Jan 09, 2017"

I am sure my girls will always remember my nerdish obsession with HARRY POTTER.THIS BOOK: HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Is not for ALL children under the age of oh let's say 10.It is full of death and killing. Of course it was coming, all this drastic drama, but I really do not see a reason for J.K. Rowling to feel she needed to kill certain people.I will not spoil WHO gets the axe, but I have never cried so much in any of these books!However in LIFE there comes DEATH, and some people must stand up and choose between what is RIGHT and what is EASY!And I will always remember the ones who gave their lives in this book to make the Witch & Wizarding world safe once more!A great read, I am planning to keep this as all the books in my collection for as long as I live. I will re read them all again and again.I wait for the MOVIES 6 and 7!THANKS! Nikki Jo","Aug 20, 2007"

Always.""I've been staring at this blank box for over 10 minutes trying to think of a way to start reviewing the majesty of a book that was Deathly Hallows.There are truly too many emotions clouding my judgement at the moment, just give me a sec.First off I want to say that I'm utterly heartbroken, not only because this book was heartbreaking itself, but because I've just finished reading the Harry Potter series for the first time. I had seen the movies, many, many, MANY times, but I'd never picked up the books, don't ask me, I honestly don't know why. Now that it's over, I truly don't know what to do with myself, I'm so invested in this world, and in this story...to not have another book to look forward to is the most saddening thing. But, still, it was an indescribable experience, and I'm so glad I decided to start this journey back on September. I remember that I actually read Harry's first September 1st scene, on September 1st. I don't know why that brings me so much happiness. The coincidence made it feel like fate, and I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CHEESY, IT'S REAL.On to the good stuff: THIS BOOK WAS UNREAL. Everything, literally EVERYTHING was pure magic. Pun intended. This epic conclusion was, by far, the best series closer I've ever read in my life, nothing could beat this magnificent ending. Everything was so well explained, and thought-out, many loose-ends from other books were corrected in this conclusion, making every book essential, every pointless detail was taken into consideration, and made part of something bigger. That's where J. K. Rowling's true magic lies: being able to forge simple details and conversations into something so big, none of us could see it coming.Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's friendship was severely tested in this book, and their weaknesses were enhanced, so we got to witness the good, the bad, and the ugly that each character has, part because of the environment they endured for basically the whole book (being hunted 24/7, and having to live in the woods for a ridiculously long period of time) and because of the Horcruxes' effect. The whole deal with the Horcruxes was utterly fascinating, every aspect of it intrigued me, from Voldemort's fascination with conquering death, to how he came to know about the Horcruxes, to how he started making them, to the importance of his past, to the though-out locations where he hid them, to the effect they had on people, to how they had to be destroyed, and to the fact that he made a seventh unintended Horcrux that lived inside the boy he most desired to kill. The irony in all of it made me relish with amazement. Something I'd missed with the movies were the lengthy explanations that we get with the book, the explanations of why this Horcrux lived inside Harry, why he lived through two Killing Curses, and how Dumbledore wasn't truly the great man we thought he was.I'm not going to go into a lot of details about the book in case some of you haven't read it, or don't know what happens. Basically, I loved all of this:1. RON AND HERMIONE. -- this the book where Ron's actively trying to start things up with Hermione, with his love advice book at the beginning, and his distraught at Voldemort's Harry/Hermione ship (the scene when he destroys the Horcrux), and protecting her at EVERY moment. This book made Ron shine so much, through the ups and downs, we say an incredible, loyal man.2. HARRY AND GINNY. -- I mean. MUST I SAY MORE? I LOVE THEM.3. THAT EPILOGUE, MAN. -- Perfection. I do wish we'd gotten intel about what became of our three main characters: did Harry become an Auror? What did Hermione & Ron end up doing?4. The EPIC HOGWARTS BATTLE -- Neville. UGH what a SWEETHEART.5. EVERYTHING THAT HAD TO DO WITH HORCRUXES -- finding them, their locations, what they were, how to destroy them, their meaning, EVERYTHING.6. DEATHLY HALLOWS -- I ESPECIALLY loved the scene where they share the myth revolving the three objects.7. HAGRID -- THAT MAN KILLS ME. He's a sweetheart, and everything he does and says will always be beautiful to me. The scene where he has to carry Harry's body. Jesus. That scene is powerful. It brings everything full circle. 8. Kreacher's redemption: DEAR LORD, this elf was the death of me. I used to hate his GUTS, and in the movie, his redemption didn't happen, but in the book it did, and it was beautiful. He helped Harry, Ron & Hermione get one of the Horcruxes, and he had a hand in the final epic battle, where he led the elves against Voldemort's army.9. Dobby: Dobby was very painful. I can't quite put into words how much I loved this character and the sadness his ending caused me. 10. I LOVED the breaking into the Ministry's scene. EPIC. And breaking into Gringotts was SO MUCH FUN, Hermione's impression of Bellatrix was everything.11. SNAPE'S TRUTH: This was my absolute favorite part of the book. When we (FINALLY!) get to see his memories, and see how he's been protecting Harry all this time, was truly on our side, and beautiful his character actually was... He wasn't perfect. He wasn't a great guy. He had his flaws. But he was real. He was loyal, to a fault. He protected, even when sometimes he shouldn't. He was a magnificent character with an incredible arc, without a doubt my favorite character of all-time. Watching him during this book was heartbreaking, but the end was worth it. When Harry finally found out the truth...it was worth it. Silver doe. SILVER DOE. Enough said. I'm done. No more.12. ""Not my daughter, YOU BITCH"" -- epic.When Percy came back, to help in the Hogwarts battle... I broke down. I broke down BAD. And his stunning scene with Fred... where Perce made that joke. I still can't quite put into words how much it affected me. My heart breaks. Every time.As I said, this was an amazing experience, I can't wait to reread them, and then re-read all my reviews. It's been amazing.I really can't say more, I keep crying every time I write a new bullet, so I'm gonna go, watch the final two movies, and cry some more. If you're still here, thank you for reading. You're the best. <3","Aug 03, 2015"
"9780545010221","2314568","Steve","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2314568-steve","The bar of expectation has been set phenomenally high for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. And the book not only meets the expectations, but exceeds them.The themes examined in this book are quite mature: how governments twist the truth, how newspapers and media, as the voice of the government, feed misinformation for all sorts of reasons, how trusted adults may have dark pasts and not-so-pure motives. We're past the ""simple"" issues of revenge and love and well into far more complex agendas.Many children's books (fairy tales) have clear sets of morals and well-defined heroes and enemies: the wicked stepmother, the beautiful princess, the knight in shining armor. This final volume is much more grey; the lines of black and white, good and evil, are not so clear-cut in this book. This is probably very unsettling for younger readers who need to feel secure in a world where grown-ups can be trusted. For more mature readers, this is a beautiful example of peeling back the layers of the onion of life. The series began with a very innocent view of the world, from the viewpoint of a young Harry Potter. As he aged and matured, so did our ability to see what was happening, and we saw his attempts to understand the reason for the actions of his teachers, his friends' parents, and other characters in his ever-expanding world.In Deathly Hallows, Harry is now an adult. He has turned 17, age of adulthood for wizards. He is no longer safe with his aunt and uncle, the protective spell now removed. He can take control of his own actions and path in life. As we all know (and maybe even learned the hard way), this is hardly the freedom that teenagers think it will be. That freedom to rule your own life brings the responsibility for how your actions will affect those around you, the ones that you care for. Harry's choices have a huge impact on Hermoine and Ron, and many, many others who valiantly stand by their friend.In one sense, Harry has been set on a path by Dumbledore, and perhaps all that happens is Dumbledore's fault. On the other hand, Harry has free will, and Dumbledore's instructions have always been vague at best. Harry has quite a range of choice in what he does and does not do. Almost every one of those choices are difficult at best.There are meditations here on the meaning of death and life, on the value of sacrifice. Every character has known pain and has made decisions for selfish reasons. There are celebrations of new beginnings, and there are some endings as well. These mediations shows up often in fine literature; this imagery has been around since mankind began civilization and it is an integral part of how our society works. It is central to this Deathly Hollows, and the book wouldn't be nearly as successful if Ms. Rowling didn't address these thoughts.People looking for non-stop high school hijinks and game competitions will be disappointed. This final novel has none of that. In fact, there are long stretches where the characters feel stymied, and it feels like no progress is being made. The book forces the reader to slow down, to think deeply about what is going on, to feel the strain and pressure of achieving extremely difficult goals. There are action sequences and well-described battles, but these are the exception, not the rule. Deathly Hallows is about intense internal struggles and deeply emotional challenges.The vocabulary reflects this as well. This book is not meant to be skimmed or jumped through. The wording and the sentence structure encourage the reader to go slowly, to contemplate, to think about what is being said. While Harry spends weeks contemplating issues and trying to figure out how he feels about an issue, the reader is encouraged to do the same. It's an adventure of self-exploration.As I already mentioned, the bar was set exceedingly high for this book. It was expected to be exactly perfect, a stunning work of literature appropriate for every age group. It was expected to satisfy both those who wanted a blockbuster ""Hollywood Ending"" as well as those who feel realism requires death, destruction, and bleak despair. While it did not quite achieve all of those goals (it came REALLY close), it is an outstanding book which has exposed millions of people to questions and issues they might not have otherwise encountered. It encourages people to think about the world they live in. You cannot ask any book to do much more than that.","May 11, 2015"

Intenté retrasarlo, pero adentro mío sabía que por más doloroso que fuera, tenía que darle fin a una hermosa saga. Usualmente, la gente me decía cosas como ""vas a llorarte la vida cuando lo termines, vas a ver"", e incluso antes de iniciar la saga, con ojos como platos ""¿Nunca leíste Harry Potter? Te los presto, pero leelos, lo vas a amar"" y cosas de esa índole, y yo decía ""no creo, dudo que vaya a ponerme tan sentimental"". Nunca pensé que el asunto fuera tan literal, ni tampoco imaginé que iba a pasar todo lo que pasó, no solo en el libro, sino en mi vida en general durante los momentos en los que me sumergía en la lectura. Y a medida que leía, más cuenta me daba de que me había encariñado con absolutamente todos los personajes, y que por consiguiente, más duro iba a ser el final.Es increíble lo que un buen libro le puede hacer al corazón, y me resulta casi inconcebible pensar que en algún momento de mi vida me prohibí la saga simplemente por haberme dejado abrumar por el fanatismo ajeno. Ahora veo con claridad por qué ese fanatismo, ahora veo por qué la gente siente fascinación por el mundo mágico de J.K. Rowling, y hasta me atrevo a decir que me siento parte de esa pasión. Sin embargo, siempre aprecié que fuera una autora que dio vida a la lectura en una generación que quizá no estaba tanto en la literatura. Eso es algo que te guste o no la idea de sus libros, se valora enormemente, al menos todo aquél que ame la lectura y tenga deseos de compartir éste buen hábito. Trascendió, rompió con todo, y ahora acá estoy, todavía conmocionada. Lo único que sé con certeza es que voy a volver a leerla en algún momento, porque quiero volver a sentir todo lo que sentí cuando recurrí a la saga por primera vez. Estoy gratamente sorprendida de que nadie me haya spoileado nada (las únicas veces que leí spoilers fue porque me tenté de leer artículos sobre HP, mala, muy mala mía), porque es así como mejor se vive la experiencia. Estoy triste porque no puedo creer que todo haya terminado, pero contenta de ser ahora otra afortunada que conoce éste maravilloso mundo, es una historia que quedará por siempre en mi corazón.","Jul 30, 2015"

Ξεκίνησα την ανάγνωση της σειράς απο καθαρή περιέργεια λόγω όλων αυτών που άκουγα και διάβαζα για τα βιβλια κ με μια διαθεση ""ελα μωρε τωρα υπερβολές...βιβλια για παιδάκια με μαγικά και χαζά"". Άσε που με πιάνει γενικα μια άρνηση για τα πολυσυζητημένα και τα πολυ προβαλλόμενα βιβλια. Με τούτα και με τ'αλλα ομως ξεκίνησα...Και δεν άφησα τα βιβλια απο τα χέρια μου μέχρι την τελευταια σειρα. Το πρώτα σίγουρα που μπορω να πω ηταν οτι η ανάγνωση ηταν εθιστική. Είχα στη διαθεση μου όλη τη σειρα εξ αρχής και απλά δεν μπορούσα να σταματήσω! Διαβασα τα δυο πρώτα βιβλια στα ελληνικά και όλα τα υπόλοιπα στα αγγλικά. Η γραφή της Rowling έρεε σα νεράκι, με συνεχεία, λυρικότητα, χιούμορ. Όσο περνούσαν τα βιβλια, όσο ωριμαζαν οι ήρωες, ωρίμαζε και η γραφή. Τα δυο πρώτα σίγουρα ειναι απλά, αν οχι απλοϊκά, αλλα απο το τρίτο και μετα, η υπόθεση και η γραφή σοβαρεύουν και γίνονται συναρπαστικά.Τα ένιωσα τα βιβλια. Με έκαναν να τα νιώσω. Κατακλύστηκα απο συναισθήματα, συμπονουσα τους ήρωες, έπασχα μαζι τους, γελούσα, στεναχώριομουν, αγχωνόμουν. Δεν θα ξεχάσω την ανάγνωση του Τάγματος του Φοίνικα..Πως με έβαλε απο την πρώτη στιγμή στην μαύρη και δυσοίωνη ατμόσφαιρα, αυτο το σφίξιμο στο στομάχι που ένιωθα καθόλη τη διάρκεια της ανάγνωσης...Και το Κύπελλο της Φωτιάς (το αγαπημένο μου όλων) με τις τόσες ανατροπές πλοκής και συναισθημάτων..Η Rowling με έβαλε σε έναν μαγικό-απ' όλες τις απόψεις-κόσμο και δε μα άφησε να βγω ως το τελος. Ένας κοσμος καινούριος, με μαγικά πλάσματα, μάγους, ξωτικά, ξόρκια, ενα σχολείο διαφορετικό απο όλα τα αλλα, ενα άθλημα-λατρεία και τα λοιπά και τα λοιπά...Ένας τέλεια φτιαγμένος κοσμος τόσο διαφορετικός και τόσο ίδιος με τον κόσμο μας (δυστυχώς ειμαι κι εγω μια ταπεινή muggle). Γιατι και σε εκείνον τον κόσμο, υπαρχει το καλο και το κακό, η τιμιότητα και η διαφθορά, η άνευ όρων φιλια, η θυσία, η αγάπη, ο έρωτας, τα νεανικά σκιρτήματα, οι αγωνιες..όλα. Και οφείλω να πω οτι η συγγραφέας κατάφερε να περάσει τόσα μηνύματα μέσα απο αυτόν τον μαγικό κόσμο που πραγματικά με εξέπληξε. Δεν θα πω τίποτα για την υπόθεση αλλωστε ειναι λίγο πολυ γνωστή. Αλλα οι ήρωες ειναι τόσο δουλεμένοι, έχουν βάθος, δίκη τους προσωπικότητα, μεγαλώνουν κατα τη διάρκεια της σειράς και εμεις το βλεπουμε αυτο, το νιώθουμε, το ζούμε. Αν μη τι άλλο, ειναι ένας συγγραφικος άθλος αυτο. Σε κάθε περίπτωση, και πιστέψτε με γελάω με τον εαυτό μου που το λεω αυτο, ο Χάρι Ποτερ ειναι μια αναγνωστική εμπειρία που πρεπει να τη ζήσετε. P.S.1 Με χάλασε λίγο το τελος, αλλα το ταξίδι ηταν υπέροχο και δεν μπορω να στερήσω ούτε μισό αστεράκι απο αυτο!!!P.S. 2 RIP to the bravest man in the world!P.S 3 Θα τα ξαναδιαβασω ΣΙΓΟΥΡΑ (Άκου που κατάντησα, εγω, ποιος εγω, που γελούσα με τους χαριποτερικους","Jan 31, 2016"

I was so emotional throughout this whole thing. From the happiness of Harry reuniting with his friends, to the sadness of when so many dearly beloved characters died, and not to mention the anger at Dumbledore for his intricate web of lies, and the hopefulness when Dumbledore explained himself, and I realized he could be forgiven. ""'Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?'"" Everything came to a close perfectly. I don't really think JK Rowling could have done better. Hedwig, Mad-Eye, Ted, Fred, Lupin, and Tonks will all, forever be missed. But that was what was so brilliant about this book. It was emotional, and raw, and real. And I am forever thankful for it. ""'Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love."" Do I love this series with all my heart? Will I read it again and again? Will it be a part of me from now on?The answer is simple. ""'Always.'"" Because, ""All was well."" Initial reaction:""All was well.""And with this book, I cried many a time. It was wonderful. It was emotional. It was everything a conclusion should be.I guess it's true what they say.

(نمونه‌اش رو می‌تونین توی ریویو بسیار کوتاهی که چندسال پیش موقع عضو شدن توی گودریدز نوشتم و اخر همین ریویو هست، ببینید.) با این حال حالا که با یه دید برتر به کتاب نگاه می‌کنم، حالا که با علم به پایان داستان مجموعه رو دوباره خوندم و حالا که سنم هم بالاتر رفته و اون هیجان انتشار کتاب آخر رو ندارم، به جرئت می‌گم که رولینگ از روز اولی که شروع به نوشتن کتاب اول کرده، آخر کتاب هفتم رو می‌دونسته. یعنی چیزی نبوده که حین نوشتن مجموعه در موردش تصمیم بگیره. حتی معتقدم مسیر اصلی رسیدن به این پایان رو توی ذهنش رسم کرده. جداً این هفت کتاب از نظر روایی آنچنان انسجامی دارند که چیزی جز این نمیتونه باشه. برای همین هم واقعا به نظرم پایانی جز این برای مجموعه بهتر نبود. اینطوری اون افکار خالص نویسنده روی برگه‌ها اومده چه ما دوست داشته باشیم و چه نداشته باشیم.هری‌پاتر از اون مجموعه‌های عجیب و تاثیرگذار زندگی من بود. اولین مجموعه فانتزی نبود که میخوندم اما توی روزهایی و با شرایط عجیب و غریبی اونو خوندم که برام هر لحظه‌اش خاطره‌انگیزه (حالا کار ندارم که خاطره تلخ یا شیرین). بعد حدود 10 سال که دوباره مجموعه‌اش رو شروع کردم هرگز فکر نمی‌کردم که مثل روز اول کتاب‌ها رو دوست داشته باشم. اگر بخوام اعترافی کنم باید بگم دوستشون داشتم و حتی بیشتر! حتی بیشتر! الان که دارم این ریویو رو می‌نویسم نمی‌دونم چقدر عمر می‌کنم، دقیقه‌ای دیگه می‌میرم یا سال‌ها عمر می‌کنم. نمیدونم که چقدر کتاب خواهم خوند و نمیدونم که تا چه زمانی از فانتزی و ادبیات لذت می‌برم اما میتونم به جرئت بگم که بعید میدونم هیچ کتابی بتونه جای هری پاتر رو برای من بگیره. من چندین سال دیگه به شرط بقای عمر دوباره به سراغ هری‌پاتر میام و از همین الان مطمئنم که لذتم از خوندنش حتی از الان هم بیشتره! میدونید، یه حس عجیب وصف نشدنی. و از همین الان که کتاب رو می‌بندم دلم داره براشون تنگ می‌شه. برای هری و جسارت‌هاش، برای رون و حماقت‌هاش، برای هرمیون و هوشش، برای لونا و عجیب بودنش، برای نویل و شهامت پنهانش، برای هاگرید و تمام کارهای رو اعصابش، برای فردی که نموند و جرجی که گوششو از دست داد، برای ارتش دامبلدور، هاگوارتز، هاگزمید، پناهگاه و حتی برای خانه شماره چهار پریوت درایو! برای اسنیپ و صد البته، دامبلدور...از نسل ما گذشت که روزهای انتشار کتاب رو دیدیم، ما می‌ریم و نسل‌های جدید هری‌پاتر خوان جای ما رو می‌گیرن و باز هم از دنبال کردن ماجراهای پسر برگزیده لذت می‌برن. پسری که فکر می‌کنم برای نسل‌ها خاطره‌سازی کنه و همدم لحظات تنهایی خیلی از آدم‌ها باشه. همونطور که برای من کرد و همدم روزهای سخت من شد، حالا و آخر داستان باید بگم که ازت ممونم هری، پسری که زنده موند...پ.ن 1: اگر این ریویو بیشتر از اینکه شبیه ریویو بوده باشه، شبیه مرثیه‌ای برای هری‌پاتر شده و شما تا اینجا خوندینش و چندان خوشتون نیومده، ازتون معذرت می‌خوام اما دوست داشتم یه جایی و یه جوری بتونم حسم نسبت به این مجموعه رو بیرون بریزم.پ.ن 2: این بار خیلی برام عجیب بود سر مرگ دابی خیلی گریه کردم! عجیبه که برای خودم بلند بلند میخوندم و اشک می‌ریختم. نمیدونم شاید وقتی یه غمی رو بشنوی به جای اینکه بخونی، بیشتر دلت می‌گیره.پ.ن 3: بازگشت هری از مرگ و صحنه مرگش به شدت منو به یاد صحنه مرگ اصلان روی میز سنگی به دست جادیس میندازه. حتی نحوه توصیف فضا و به نظرم میاد که رولینگ از این داستان بی تاثیر نبوده.پ.ن 4: همیشه موقع خوندن داستان آرزو داشتم یکی مثل رون و هرمیون رو کنارم داشته باشم. برای آدمی مثل من چنین چیزی همیشه مثل یه توهم خوش‌آیند بود اما الان واقعا یه رون و هرمیون کنارم دارم! این شاید یکی از بزرگترین موهبت‌هایی باشه که به من داده شده...«در دنیای زنده‌ها چیزهایی هست که خیلی خیلی بدتر از مردنه»جمعه 26 شهریور 1395 -------------قبلاها نوشت:آخرین کتاب. اونطور که انتظار میرفت پیش نرفت . اگه یکی از سه شخصیت اصلی میمردن جالب تر میشد.هرچند همینجوریش هم جالب بود و جزو بهترین کتابای مجموعه.رولینگ برای تموم کردن کتاب یکسری مسائل رو انگار از جیبش درآورد!کاملا معلوم بود کتاب سرو تهش بسته شده و جا داشت که یک کتاب دیگه ادامه پیدا کنه .","Apr 25, 2012"

So, Harry Potter. I finally finished reading all of them. It took me forever and a day, but I did it! For some reason this one took me a particularly long time. Don't know why. I kept being like, ""*Reads five pages* .... OKAY! Off to do something else."" I guess because it was a little slow starting out. The first half of it was a lot of sitting around in the woods and being like *ARGUE ARGUE ARGUE* But, it got a lot better as it went along. I know J.K. Rowling did have to tie up a lot of things, so that's probably why it was so long and had so much information, etc.Anyway. So I read the second half of it in the car on a 2-hour ride home from Connecticut about a week ago. And toward the end it was getting dark outside, so I had to use my iPod as a flashlight and it was rather difficult and I was getting a headache. But I was like, ""MUST. FINISH."" It was a good ending. Very satisfying. I've heard people complain about the ending being too happy and whatnot, but it wasn't really ... I mean, half the characters died. (Well, okay, not half. But a lot.) It was bittersweet. And heck, after all that crap he went through, HARRY POTTER DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.Blah blah blah. Still wracking my brain for things to say. I don't know. The thing is, the series was a bit ruined for me because I waited so long to read them; hence, I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen and was mentally/emotionally prepared for everything. So it's kind of hard to evaluate.UMMMM well. I know everyone says this but ... oh my gosh, this series has so much detail. As a writer I utterly fail at details. I'm like, ""I should probably explain this more. Nah. I should give this character some kind of backstory. Nah."" Whereas, J.K. Rowling has some crazy detailed history for every single one of her characters. AGGGHHH. How did she write these books in less than a hundred years? There's a purpose for everyone and everything in these books. And evidently, she had the last book planned even when she was writing the first book. A lot of series fall flat on the planning aspect; they seem like the author says to his/herself, ""Meh, I don't have any other ideas so I'll just write some crappy sequel to that other thing I wrote!"" But with Harry Potter, there's a reason for every book, and for everything that happens––even the smallest details. Just .... GAHHH GAHHHHHH HHHAAHGKL;KLDJ. I don't know how to express my awe. It's not fair. I now feel the need to write 100-page outlines for everything I'm writing ... which I guess is a good thing. Anyway, so, the characters. Well, as I said, there's a reason for all of them. And they all have such cool backstories. Except Harry Potter is kind of annoying. And I wish Ginny had been more interesting and that Harry's interest in her hadn't been so random. But, whatevs. I like everyone else. Ron and Hermione are an adorable couple. Voldemort is really creepy (but I love his backstory). Dobby is awesome *cries*. And OHMYGOSH I love Snape. He's so cool. I was the most sad about his death. Especially afterward when you find out his whole backstory. He and Lily had such a sweet relationship. It was so sad. AGGGH. That was the only part that almost made me cry. (Don't get me wrong, a lot of other parts made me sad, it's just that books rarely make me shed actual tears.)Recently I read this thing on Cracked.com about how it would have been cool if it turned out Neville had been the Chosen One all along. Haha. That would've been kind of awesome. But oh well. The ending was still awesome. (This has nothing to do with anything, I just wanted to mention it.)Sorry this review has pretty much no thought or structure to it whatsoever. I'm just not sure how to sum up my thoughts on all seven books. I should read them again sometime to find any cool details I might have missed––now that I know everything that happens, yada yada. Right now I just feel kinda overwhelmed by the series as a whole though, so I probably won't be rereading them for a while. But anyway, they were great.I kind of wonder whether Rowling will ever write anything else. Maybe she's the Harper Lee type and only had one good story to tell. Also I feel like if she writes about anything else, everyone will be like, ""THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS HARRY POTTER."" But, oh well. I'm sure the Harry Potter legacy will live on. People will keep reading these books to their kids. J.K. Rowling is probably set for life. So, WOOHOOOO!ONE MORE THING.I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.I just love saying that. :] Heh heh.","Feb 18, 2011"
"9780545010221","15154637","Kate ♡","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15154637-kate","BLOG REVIEW:https://passthefeels.wordpress.com/20...Well, I had written half of this review and it just decided to delete itself, so heres take 2 I guess. It was much more poetic the first time... *fumes*I usually don't know where to start with reviews, however this time I feel both like I'll never be able to start, as much as I feel like I'll never be able to stop.I guess I'll just start by simply saying:
  I love Harry Potter.
I would, without a doubt, not be the person I am today without it.I grew up with the films, and read the books later on in life, which I do not regret, as I believe it allowed me to have full understanding and appreciation for the novels, at this age.Anyway, this is not a shrine, it's a review, sooo, here we go.This book was incredible. More so than I ever imagined. I loved it, and it's going straight to the favourites of all time shelf.I don't even really know exactly what to say, all I know is it was amazing from start to finish, but I'll try to form coherent sentences through my shock that I've actually finished reading these now...Looking back on the novel whilst trying to write this review has made me realise how every chapter is like a mini book. Each named appropriately to it's contents, which have taken up little places in my mind, as if they've been filed into categories.From the very beginning, when Harry finally departed from the Dursleys, my heart swelled. Rowling could not have written that scene any better. I just feel it was done perfectly to solidify the way in which they and Harry felt about each other, truly, in the end.I found the entire quest for the horcruxes to be so enthralling. The three friends and their voyage to take down Voldemort, as well as help each other. Especially Hermione and Harry's time in Godric's Hollow, that swelled my heart.The Tale of the Three Brothers. The Deathly Hallows! I have always been fascinated with this, and have never quite fully understood them simply through the film, but reading about it just gave me this whole new insight into the stories and history behind this brilliant idea Rowling had. I absolutely loved this huge aspect of the novel.Severus! The worldly conflict, the never ending debate on whether or not he was a good man... I have finally made up my mind on whether I love him or hate him, and have decided that I love him. Yep. One of the other millions of favourite moments throughout this book has to be the Pensieve scene, surrounding Snapes memories. Harry's journey through Snapes mind was so incredibly interesting, and certainly both made and broke my heart. To finally understand why Snape was the way he was, ahh, just, yes.The Battle of Hogwarts. Do I really need to say more? Wow. The ending, the whole last section was just brilliant. I think it may even be my favourite last part of a book ever. It was executed so well, and tied everything together so well. Once again, the appreciation for Fred and Georges humour, even in times of sorrow, was one of the many highlights of this entire series. As well as Harry, Hermione and Ron's friendship. Their friendship, I believe, is one of the most, if not the most, important aspects of the entire series. I am obsessed with them, in-fact all of the relationships Rowling manages to create are so intricate, and really tug on the heart strings.We got to see the continued relationship between Harry and Dumbledore, which was so nice. I even found myself warming to Kreacher! Oh how unexpected, but lovely.19 years later...Ahhh, I could not deal with this part! It was everything. I feel so lucky to have finally been able to read it. Also, to now be able to continue on with The Cursed Child.Anyway, this is definitely the longest review I have ever done, and I think it's time to stop.If you made it this far, thank you for reading, and I hope (I'm sure) you loved this book as much as I did (or are excited to read it).I'm going to go wipe my tears, watch the Deathly Hallows movies, and fantasise about starting the whole series again... I might just do that. Bye!Order of favourite to least favourite HP book:1. Deathly Hallows2. Half Blood Prince3. Order of the Phoenix4. Philosophers Stone5. Prisoner of Azkaban6. Goblet of Fire7. Chamber of Secrets","Dec 26, 2016"

I didn't really enjoy The Deathly Hallows as much as I enjoyed the previous books (although I did still thoroughly enjoy it) it was lacking Beloved characters and settings the previous books had until the very end. I missed Hogwarts, I missed Hagrid, Dumbledore, Neville, Luna. The first half of the book up until Harry, Ron and Hermione arrived at Hogwarts was a little too slow for me!On the other hand, the second half of the book was fantastic! The battle of Hogwarts was written so well, I was on edge the whole time! There was a lot of deaths that broke my heart and a lot of twists (that I actually saw coming because I saw the movie first, haha.) My favorite chapter has to be 'The Princes Tale' Snape is such a wonderful character and JK. Rowling wrote the characters story so so well!Overall, I did really enjoy this even though it lacked a lot in the first half. It was beautifully written and the ending was perfect! I loved the whole 19 years later chapter, it was an amazing end to a fantastic series!

Still all 5* of course, but I was not head over heels again with this series. This book gave me all those feelings, and made me fall head over heels completely in love with this world. I absolutely love how this book ends and concludes it all. I love the battle.I'm currently rewatching the movies, I've seen the first two, and I'm already excited to be watching the last two movies because I love this book so much now haha!What an amazing job Rowling has done to let the books grow with you.

"9780545010221","4422684","Kristin","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4422684-kristin","I feel like this isn't a Harry Potter novel. It doesn't follow Rowling's typical formula of following Harry's rule-breaking antics at Hogwarts and there is a crap ton of stuff that happens in this book. To read this book as a Harry Potter lover is a very emotional journey; it is truly heart breaking. For me, when this book first came out it marked the end of my childhood. I was in 5th grade when the first one came out and a freshman in college when this one finally hit shelves. My heart has never recovered from the ending of this series...I don't know where this ranks on my ""Harry Potter list"" because it's sort of an outlier to the series and it's a hard book to read (there should be a warning label that tissues are required). Here is my list of Harry Potter novels in order of my most favorite to my least favorite (for those who care...I guess! ha ha): 1.)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince2.)Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire3.)Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban4.)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix5.)Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone6.)Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*Honorable mention - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (seriously I can't rank this one)What a journey it was re-reading these!

Coincido con muchos en que Rowling desató su lado malvado en esta historia, porque hay sucesos que pueden solo justificarse de esa manera. Por otro lado, los misterios que se van desenrollando a lo largo de las páginas resultan uno más macabro que otro, y eso no es que logre aplacar nuestros nervios ante lo que pueda sucederle a nuestros queridos personajes. Además, hay una cosa en la que coincido y a la vez disiento con muchas personas. Creo que una acción buena puede justificar alguna que otra mala, pero no años de maldad, aunque entiendo a aquellos que piensan que un último acto de bondad lo puede todo. En principio podría decirse que en este séptimo libro de la saga, Harry, Ron y Hermione viven una nueva aventura, pero al ser ya adultos, esa aventura no es necesariamente divertida e inofensiva. Por último, este libro me ha roto el corazón, me lo ha dejado en cachitos y me lo ha vuelto a armar, pero el daño ya estaba hecho. Por supuesto es más que recomendable.","Oct 05, 2016"

La cantidad de veces que me reí, que lloré, que me emocioné fueron interminables. Aparte con toda esta relectura y en especial con este último libro tengo que afirmar, una vez más, que Rowling sabía demasiado bien lo que estaba haciendo al construir la historia. Hay tantos indicios de lo que se venía y tantos otros que explican cosas a las que normalmente la gente no pone mucha atención.Si alguien no ha leído el libro(debajo de qué piedra viven?), aviso altiro que no taparé los spoilers.Creo que la mayoría recuerda las cosas importantes de este libro, por lo que me voy a centrar en cosas más específicas esta vez. Obvio que de nuevo sufrí eñe en muchas partes, la historia de Kreacher, cómo Voldemort lo usó para probar la protección del relicario y cómo desestimó al pobre, pensando que moriría ahí, Dios, ese momento como que te desgarra y lo más maravilloso es cómo Harry se porta con él después, o sea lo de regalarle el relicario de Regulus y cómo después cambia toda la actitud del elfo con ellos, es hermoso, siempre sufriré por el pastel de carne y riñones que no alcanzaron a comer. También está el momento en que Ron se va. ODIO ese momento, es tan triste ver cómo se rompe el vínculo que une a Harry y Ron, fue como volver al cuarto libro cuando no se hablaban. Al mismo tiempo, es genial cómo se arma la historia de Ron y cómo uno puede entender porqué le afecta tanto la situación de andar sin rumbo fijo, pasar hambre y frío, que el horrocrux lo afectara tanto; y también ver cómo llega de vuelta a ellos, ese momento maravilloso en que rescata a Harry del pozo donde estaba la espada de Gryffindor y después destruye el horrocrux, me encanta.Cuando uno llega a cierto momento en este libro, no puede parar, porque empieza a desencadenarse una serie de acontecimientos que te arrastran a seguir la lectura, como que ya no depende de ti parar, sino que es casi una fuerza mayor la que te tira. A mí me pasa desde la Mansión Malfoy en adelante o incluso antes, cuando van a ver a Xenophilius Lovegood.Sé que mucha gente no le ve el sentido a las Reliquias en la historia, pero sin ellas, sin que las hubiesen explicado, muchas cosas no se habrían solucionado en este libro. Solo por dar un ejemplo, cuando Harry va finalmente al Bosque a entregarse a Voldemort, no habría podido pasar a los dementores si no hubiese sido porque usó la Piedra de la Resurrección y se acompañó por sus papás, Sirius y Lupin. Ni empezar a hablar del entendimiento que tuvo Harry de cómo funcionaba la Varita de Saúco jamás habría tenido la seguridad que tuvo al vencer a Voldemort al final. Es por esto mismo que amo mucho la conversación con Dumbledore en King's Cross. Me voy a detener aquí, porque si no, escribiría por siempre jajajaDescargos:FRED!! por qué tuvo que morir Fred T.T?Snape, nunca te querré y odio infinito a quienes le dieron el perdonazo.Me encantan los momentos en que aparece Draco, siento que su transformación es muy notoria desde el libro anterior. El crucio de Harry <3!McGonagall, te amo.Quise cachetear a Hermione unas cuantas veces.Amo que Harry reparara su varita.JK, maestra.","Apr 12, 2017"

Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love.5/5 starsAnd it all comes to an end. This book is the fantastic finale of Harry Potter series. I can’t be more satisfied. From the beginning, it’s full of breathtaking actions. Finally it’s an all out war for both sides. And I’m glad even though the story mostly set in various places, they still went back to Hogwarts in the end because I love the school. The final battle was just epic. Everyone involved. The students, Order of Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, graduated students , the statues, the ghosts, even Peeves the poltergeist. It’s like a horrible reunion. Sure there’re deaths, and there were some characters I like among them T.T but there were also surprises, things that I didn’t expect. Malfoy became kind heroic for a brief moment when he saved Goyle’s life. Neville Longbottom became awesome. He’s not only lead Hogwarts’ resistance against the Carrows but he fought fearlessly that even Voldemort was impressed with him. And remember Neville’s boggart? It’s seemed that he was scared if his grandmother with a good reason. The old lady was truly scary when she’s angry. The twist is just cruel. I can’t say much without spoil it but.. well, it’s cruel. I can’t find other words for it. I love how Harry turned to be the big hero here. I admit that there were times in previous books where I was a bit disappointed on Harry’s character development but at the end, he’s wonderful in this book. Usually Hermione was the one played big roles in solving mysteries but Harry did it by himself here. I don’t know how to express what I think about this book but that it’s exceed my expectations. A wonderful book. Really recommended for all fantasy reader. :D","Aug 03, 2015"

Pity the living, and above all those who live without love.” Started reading the Harry Potter series on Christmas 2016 and ended it on New Year's Eve 2017. Couldn't have made it better. I loved every second of it, every dialogue between Harry and Ron and Hermione, every character, every member of the Weasley Family and the Order of the Phoenix and Dumbledores Army. Every fighting scene. Every death scene. Every love scene. This is just the best series ever written and it has a special place in my heart with The Mortal Instruments. I know I could tattoo these two series on my body and I would still love them as dearly in 50 years. They just mean the world to me. Now to this book: It was definitely my favorite of the series. I didn't expect it to be since there is not a lot of Hogwarts and my favorite characters and it's frustrating and hard, but I loved it the most. I just couldn't stop reading. I knew what was gonna happen, I've watched every movie at least 30 times, but I still stopped breathing at so many pages. I am so sad this has come to an end, I know I can reread it whenever I feel like it but it still won't be the same as the first time.

  Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows
 for what seemed like the gazillionth time. I didn’t want to write a review. Again. It’s been done and it was a gushing, brimming with love and adulation write-up.Today, I just wanted to make a mini-keepsake. A little something for all my Potterhead friends. Something that encapsulated all the key moments in the books...moments that moved me...moments that made me smirk gleefully..moments that broke my heart (in a nice way, if that’s even possible). So here goes:——————————————————————————————-MOMENT #1:
  ‘I don’t think you’re a waste of space.’
——————————————————————————————-MOMENT #2:
  “Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?’ asked Scrimgeour. ‘No I’m not,’ retorted Hermione. ‘I’m hoping to do some good in the world!’
——————————————————————————————-MOMENT #3:
  On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981, Lily and James Potter lost their lives. Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard ever to have survived the Killing Curse. This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left in it’s ruined state as a monument to the Potters and as a reminder of the violence that tore apart their family.
——————————————————————————————-MOMENT #4:
  RON:’He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn’t he? He - well, he must’ve known I’d run out on you.’HARRY:’No, he must’ve known that you’d always want to come back.'
——————————————————————————————-Moment #5:
  ‘Dobby has no master!’ squealed the elf. ‘Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!’
——————————————————————————————-Moment #6:
  Here lies Dobby, a Free Elf.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #7:
  ‘The wand chooses the wizard,’ said Ollivander.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #8:
  ‘PIERTOTUM LOCOMOTOR!’And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armour jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same.‘Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!’
 ——————————————————————————————-Moment #9:
  ‘No,’ said Ron seriously, ’ I mean we should tell them to get out. We don’t want any more Dobbys, do we? We can’t order them to die for us -‘There was a clatter as the Basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione’s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #10:
  And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred’s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #11:
  - CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE -The Prince’s Tale
——————————————————————————————-Moment #12:
  ‘Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?’‘For him?’ shouted Snape. ‘Expecto Patronum!’From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe:she landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears.‘After all this time?’Always,’ said Snape.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #13:
  ‘You’ll stay with me?’‘Until the very end,’
——————————————————————————————-Moment #14:
  ‘Tell me one last thing,’ said Harry. ‘Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?’‘Ofcourse it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?’
——————————————————————————————-Moment #15:
  ‘He is dead!’ Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #16:
  ‘I’ll join you when hell freezes over,’ said Neville.‘Dumbledore’s Army!’ he shouted.
——————————————————————————————-Moment #17:
  ‘NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!’
——————————————————————————————-Moment #18:
  ‘Avada Kedavra!’
‘Expelliarmus!’——————————————————————————————-Moment #19: (…and I liked the fact that it was appropriately enough, the 19th moment)
  The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.

"9780545010221","4097024","Tintin","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4097024-tintin","STORY:Harry finally realizes what it takes to defeat Voldemort – but it is no easy solution. What choice will he make?ENJOYMENT FACTOR:I started this over a year and a half ago and hated it so much I left it unfinished 1/3 of the way. I finally coerced myself to finish it before seeing the final HP movie. I didn’t hate it as much the 2nd time around (I think the loathing may have been partly due to the bad taste that Book 6 left in my mouth) and despite myself I enjoyed the story (for the most part). Rowling fleshes out her characters, showing the good and bad in them (prime example: Dumbledore). Rowling also aces at raising the stakes, shrouding the plot in mystery, getting her characters in trouble and out again. The plotline is convoluted and it sags heavily in the middle but the secrets kept this reader plodding along.WRITING STYLE:Rowling’s love of adverbs borders on the obscene. The greatest affront is in the last chapter:Harry to his son: “Albus Severus, you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I have ever known.”Really, Rowling? Snape worked as a double-agent to the two most powerful wizards at great personal cost, duped Death Eaters and Order members alike, endured the hate and distrust of all, sacrificed his life for love, and HARRY CAN’T EVEN BE FREAKING SURE that he was the bravest!??!Fortunately the movie’s scriptwriters promptly fixed this oversight.OTHER OBSERVATIONS (The X Factor):As I watched the movie soon after finishing the book, it’s difficult for me to divorce the two. I LOVED the movie. If only for those 5 minutes of Snape’s memories in the pensieve, the most moving performance I have seen in recent years. (All hail Alan Rickman!) I know people are complaining about all the revisions, but I actually appreciated most of the things they changed in the movie. They cut out the plodding (and unnecessary parts), focused on the meat and bones, and fixed all the inconsistencies and awkward plotting I noticed in the book. For example:1)	Ravenclaw’s diadem (a horcrux) was accidentally destroyed in the book by Fiendyre. The explanation being that the cursed fire was so potent it was one of the few things that could destroy a horcrux. Sorry but I don’t buy that. If so, Harry and co. shouldn’t have wasted their time and energy looking for a magical object (Sword of Gryffindor) to destroy the horcrux when they could have used their energies to learn the Fiendfyre curse instead. They fixed this in the movie by using a Basilisk fang to destroy the horcrux instead of Fiendfyre.2)	In the book I had no idea how Neville pulled the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat – wasn’t it stolen by Griphook? The movie makes this clearer. 3)	I liked the scene where Harry realizes what he MUST do to defeat Voldemort (I believe it’s the climax of the entire series), but I found Harry’s face-off with his archnemesis cheesy to the point of being ridiculous. He duels with the most murderous and evil Wizard in history in full view of the entire school because, as he tells Voldy: ’I sacrificed my life for them so now they’re immune to you. You can’t hurt them!’ I understand the rationale (same principle as his mother’s sacrifice) but that doesn’t stop me from rolling my eyes. They fixed this in the movie by moving the duel in a private area with no spectators and not giving anyone ‘magic immunity’. (Although I doubt if the light saber rays shooting from the duelers’ wands was an improvement).4)	The plot point of an Ultimate Elder Wand didn’t sit well with me. I thought by this time Harry and Voldemort would face off in a true test of skill – I expected something along wandless magic. But why bother when you can win by technicality and have an Elder Wand to Rule Them All (a.k.a. deus ex machina). Unfortunately this plot hole was beyond the scope of the movie to fix.That said, I think the book and movie complement each other perfectly. The movie highlights the best parts and improves on the story, while the book gives a thorough explanation of everything. COMMENT ON THE HP SERIES AS A WHOLE:Rowling’s greatest achievement is in creating memorable, distinctive characters and a magical world readers would want to live in again and again. I remember being struck with awe when I read Book One nearly a decade ago. However, I found Rowling’s stories increasingly diluted and un-enjoyable from Book 4. Not because of the dark tone, but because the convoluted plot lines made it harder to figure out the true story beneath. Coincidentally, this was also the time Rowling probably fired her editor and her books afflicted with elephantiasis syndrome.My major disappointment with the series, however, is the uselessness of its main character. Harry Potter never improved in his abilities— his achievements are from pure luck and genetics. He doesn’t study, he doesn’t practice, he doesn’t make the effort. Even his questionable talents in wizardry and Parseltongue could be directly attributed to Voldemort. Harry Potter is mediocre, and remained a mediocre pawn of Dumbledore all through out.","Aug 02, 2010"
"9780545010221","193255","Sarah","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193255-sarah","December 2017This is the first time I have listened to the series on audiobook, and I think I got something new from them as I do with every re-read. July 2009After my second reading of this book, I have so many more feelings and comments about it than I did after the first reading. But I think those comments mainly deal with the series as a whole, rather than just this book, and this book (being the conclusion of the saga) just brings some of the brilliance of the entire series more fully into focus. I may take a page from Madeleine's book and write a review of the entire series. I also think that this is a series I could read once a year. July 2007Wow. I cannot believe it's over! This book was an absolute emotional roller coaster. I don't even know where to start so I'm just going to list some random thoughts:1. I am exceedingly happy (and surprised) that the trio survived. I was sure Ron or Hermione was going to die. In the scene where Bellatrix is torturing Hermione, I thought that was going to be it and I was pissed that Ron never got the chance to tell her how much he loved her. 2. Along those same lines, I didn't really like how LONG it took Ron and Hermione to finally get together. I understand this is war, and there were more pressing things on their minds than dating, but they escaped death so many times that I thought they'd declare their love for each other out of the heat of the moment. It was cute how, once Ron finally embraced Hermione's passion for S.P.E.W., she lays one on him.3. The death of Dobby was very sad. But Dobby would have wanted to die saving Harry Potter. This was not the first time he risked everything to come to Harry Potter's aid. I think it'll be harder for me to read the second time, though, The first time, I was so worried that Hermione was going to die that it numbed the pain of Dobby's death. But the funeral scene was very sad.4. I was very saddened by Fred's death, but I wasn't altogether surprised. I never thought that all of the Weasleys would survive, and I figured it would be Fred or George. I was really happy to see Ginny, Hagrid, and Neville live. I was also sad about Tonks and Lupin, but I think it's intersting that Harry's godson was orphaned in the fight to defeat Voldemort just as Harry was. It'll definitely give Harry some insight into his godson's feelings. But my question is, who raised him? Clearly, he didn't grow up living with Harry, so did he get raised by Tonks' mother? 5. My ""Yay for you!"" character moments: Dudley shaking Harry's hand. Mrs. Weasley calling Bellatrix a bitch. Percy redeeming himself. NEVILLE stepping up and becoming a full-on leader with the DA, and then drawing the sword out of the hat and killing Nagini, allowing Harry to defeat Voldemort once and for all!6. I wish we'd have had a few more clues throughout the series as to Dumbledore's past. I never even knew he had a sister, did anyone else? Even just a passing mention of her somewhere... I understand now why Dumbledore had to die. I mean, I knew it would have something to do with Harry needing to go it alone, but it was more than that. Had Dumbledore been around for Harry to ask about the Deathly Hallows, I think things would have turned out differently.7. Voldemort's arrogance was his undoing. He was too arrogant to think there would be more to the prophecy, so he went after baby Harry, thereby fulfilling his own prophecy and equipping Harry with his own power, his own soul. He was arrogant enough to think that Harry's blood in his own veins would give him Lily's protection without giving Harry any ties to him. He was arrogant enough to think that his own wand would work against Harry, arrogant enough to think Lucius' wand would work against Harry, arrogant enough to think he could just steal the Elder Wand without earning it.8. Let the Christ/Messiah comparisons continue: not only did Harry willingly sacrifice himself for all of mankind, but he even was, in a way, resurrected.9. Didn't Rowling say that a non-magic person would use magic late in life? Who was it? DId I miss something?10. And finally... SNAPE! I knew he was good, I knew it, I knew it!! Brent and I had just discussed Snape carrying a torch for Lily. Brent even called it that Voldemort was going to spare Lily because Snape asked him to, and that when Lily died, Snape left Voldemort forever. I was disappointed that we learned all about Snape at the end, though, I would have liked to find out little by little, and have Harry piecing it together. I guess this way was more dramatic though. I definitely teared up when Harry named his son Albus Severus and told him that Severus Snape was probably the bravest man he ever knew.","Jul 17, 2007"

Pity the living, and, above all those who live without love.”  (You're such a wise man, Dumbledore.)A million of stars will never be enough to rate this book.No Spoilers! (I promise!)Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is by far, my favorite book of the entire series. Hands down. I'm very, VERY happy I come to the end of the series, but also sad since the series is over now. It was my 2012 summer goal and I have finally accomplished it! With help and support from my dear friends, Keertana, Jordyn, Inge, and Olivia, they all convinced me to keep reading the series and assured me that the series will keep getting better and it did! This book changed me...It had changed me in a postive way. It's one of those books that changed me and make a lasting impression upon your life. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows suprised me, made me laugh, and made me weep silent tears for an hour. There's never a single book that can changed me and I'm proud to say this is the 1st life-changers book. Why didn't I read this sooner?! Everybody gave raving and positive reviews on it, but crazy me ignored it. I'm very happy that I read the entire series. It has been one hell of a ride! :D I predict in the future when I'm old and wrinkly, I will still read this series over again and again...The characters again were smart, cunning, and well-developed from beginning to end. Lots of tragic deaths has occured in this book which will impacted lots of readers, but I'm not going to name names because it will spoiled the story for those who haven't read the series. My favorite character would have to be Snape besides Harry and his friends. I finally get to see his good/evil intentions present in the last installment. The word ""Always"" that Snape said had shown a new light in its name. This finale shows us that even the evil (bad) guys have good intentions as well and can be refer as the good guy in some cases. Snape is one of them. The ending to the book was spectacular and unforgettable to a remarkable series. The action was fast-paced and very addicting. You will find in no time you'll finish this book sooner than expected! Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is just so epic! :) Enough, said.Overall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a phenomenal. It will always engages readers and give us a sense of belonging and emotions that follow with it. I will never forget this series because it had brought possiblities to a new light and changed me in a very, very good way. (I'm almost certain it will change others as well) And for that, I will always be eternally grateful. Thank you, J.K Rowling, for writing such a phenomenal series, one that readers all over the world will never forget and will treasure beyond all else....P.S Plus, a box of tissues would be helpful to read this book....:(I STRONGLY encourage reading this series if you HAVEN'T AlREADY! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!And last, my contribution to Snape...(Thanks Snape.)______________________________________If you want to read my previous reviews of 1st-6th books of Harry Potter, just click the link below.-Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone's review -Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets's review-Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban's review-Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire's review -Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix's review-Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince's review","Oct 15, 2011"

I know most people finished their books weeks ago, but I didn't have that luxury with everything else I had going on this summer. The Girl and I decided that we wanted to reread some of the more recent books and we thought it'd be neat if we did it together. So, with her hard cover copy we read aloud the 6th book, beginning it the night we bought the 7th. Yes, it was hard not starting that right away. And even harder that I was reading it out loud, since that would take more time. But it was a whole lot more fun. I would do all the voices and inflections. I even did some of the voices with their accents (not all, my British Isles accents are limited). Of course, at the end of the 6th and several times during the 7th, I had to close the book and try to compose myself. I'm a guy and should never been seen weeping. Especially from reading! Now, if I were kicked in the nuts or my favorite team lost or my life long dog died, then it would be acceptable to openly weep. Definitely not from a book. So I had to read a line and I would see the next line and I'd have to take a few moments, while The Girl was agonized. She would exclaim, ""Well? What happened?"" And I would see what happened. I could see the next few lines. But I just couldn't say them aloud just yet. It was quite emotional. And just a few short years ago, I couldn't stand anything Harry Potter. Of course I hadn't read any of the books or seen any of the movies. I just didn't like the mass hysteria surrounding it. So I avoided it. And then people I trusted and respected began to scoff at me. The couldn't understand why I hadn't joined the Harry Potter bandwagon. The promised me that if I made it through the first two books, I would love the third. So I picked up the first book and read it in a day. I thought it was cute. I picked up the second book. And read it in a day. I thought it was cute. Then I picked up the third book. And read it in a day. I thought it was good. No. Really good. This was no Scooby Doo with magic adventure anymore. This actually had a larger story. After that, I read all the books, watched all the movies and had my own sort of theories about what was going to happen in the last book. I made my own death list (people sure to die). I made my survivor list (people sure to live). And finally The Girl and I read the last book. Of course, I went in with high expectations, but with a realistic goal of being mildly disappointed. Isn't it always the case that anything and everything that you highly anticipate never reaches the level that you thought it'd be. The last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was everything I wanted from the ending to the series. I laughed. I (almost) cried. I smiled all through it at the joy of reading it. If you haven't yet gotten into Harry Potter, move out of the cave and go to a bookstore. This is a bandwagon that I'm not ashamed to have jumped on.","Aug 14, 2007"

All the wonderful memories, the great moments now … Although I usually remember all details the first time, there were some here that I had forgotten about and revisiting them was a delight!Dumbledore is dead but Harry finally has at least some faint idea of how to defeat Voldemort so after returning to Privet Drive one last time, visiting the Burrow, running from the wedding there after a Death Eater attack and hiding at Grimauld Place for a while, he embarks on the mad search for the Horcruxes and important pieces of history. There are lots of small moments of sweetness (like Kreacher coming around) but the overall atmosphere is, of course, that of dreadful loss and action. It’s a chase, basically, but not just that. It’s also a hunt for history, the complete picture emphasizing the importance of knowledge and that was the best part for me (apart from the chapter when Harry sees Snape’s memories). I have said it so many times that many might already be fed up but I don’t care: it needs pointing out that the brilliance of Stephen Fry as a narrator never waivered. It doesn’t matter if it was quiet moments or full-on action like the Battle of Hogwarts. Fry was brilliant. Female characters, male characters, creatures; funny moments, tragic moments, shocking moments. I soon stopped picturing Fry behind a microphone but saw all the different witches and wizards, the castle and all the other places. I’ve listened to a number of audiobooks this year. In fact, I’ve come to like them very much although I never thought it possible, and many narrators were fantastic (Zara Ramm comes to mind). But not one of them came close to the quirky and brilliant Britishness of Stephen Fry and his signature narration of this series.","Dec 30, 2016"

  “Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love.” 
The seventh book of the Harry Potter series, what else can I say, in my this state of bewilderment , other than  is a Masterpiece of the ages.The innate theme of tragedy rears it’s head here . the loss of characters too dear to our hearts and the continuous hum in the background of ""it all ends here"" , our journey that lasted too long and has had the best of our hearts would actually end here . you should expect tears , a great deal of heart ache ,emotional breakdown moments , life threatening events with danger breathing down our character's necks. action packed ,violent and deathly battles and a few days sleepwalking hangover in the least of chances, in this incredible groundbreaking finale of the Harry Potter saga .the Deathly Hallows is one of the greatest fantasy books I have ever read, the characters shine the brightest in this book , it is magnificent to follow the huge character development undergoing, leaving no doubt as to the value of nobility and morality. it pulses with the sense of maturity as much as of bravery inspite of the characters youth and lack of experience , i may quote from A Torch Against the Night that i finished not long ago “Callow is the hope of our youth"" .I am not in the realm of discussing events or writing about what actually happens in the plot , because either you know every moment by heart or you most definitely should discover them yourself , but i am to talk about the wonders and the awes the book offers , about the prodigiousness of this saga , about J. K. Rowling casting a Confundus Charm on every reader of hers to end this book, then to close it whispering to themselves 
  "" Woah "" .
The themes of true friendship , genuine love and self-sacrifice are so touching , it portrays how false pride ,hunger for power and selfishness always go hand in hand with evil , even in the noblest of characters . i love that Kreacher was the one who led the house elves in their fight in the Hogwarts battle , isn't it one more powerful message of Rowling's books ? that people change if we change our attitude toward them , this series believes in second chances , in true everlasting love , believes that people are actually good at heart .And even with the final book in the series ,the one where Rowling was unlikely to surprise us, she pulls up her sleeves and writes a most incredible sequel to her previous 6 books , the awaited moment when Harry is expected to step out at forefront of the battle , to kill the Lord Voldmort and survive as he always did with a most unexpected skill, Rowling chooses not to walk down that tried and predictable path . Instead, harry's survival is to be seized this time by the acceptance of his own death , from the bravery not in fighting his way through battles but in the self-sacrifice. she shows again that the power of love is to overcome any other .It breaks my heart that no sock is efficient to free Dobby from the grasps of death , it breaks my heart that Sirius, Lupin , Tonks and Dumbledore are no more , it breaks my heart that Snape had never showed the best of him , his winningly helplessly genuinely beating heart , it breaks my heart that for George every mirror would ever be the mirror of Ersid .But, yet, I am to borrow Jhon Green's words "" it would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you "" . oh,yes . most definitely.This series means too much to me. maybe i feel like it took me too long to start reading the books , it doesn't even make sense , may be i even feel a little bit ashamed and confused about this fact , but since i was eleven , since that very year in which i watched the first harry potter movie for the first time ever and bought that schoolbag with Harry, Ron and Hermione faces on it , i loved it , I can’t fully articulate it. It just is so special and it feels weird that all these people around the world share my very same passion . I've always loved that world ,but now i do more profoundly , from a place much deeper much more sincere in my heart , i love it still and i will always do .""After all this time?Always.""","Oct 20, 2016"

With the help of Ron and Hermione, Harry is ready to carry out Dumbledore's last request. He must find the Horcruxes and destroy Voldemort.The seventh book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series leaves me asking one question...is there a rating higher than 5 Stars? If so, this is one of those books that deserves it. Rowling winds up the series with a fantastic story. Nearly all of the major characters that we were introduced to throughout the series are back. I was happy to see some of my favorites...Hagrid, Lupin, Fred and George Weasley, and Professor MacGonagall. I was even happy to see one of the characters I actually despised, Dolores Umbridge, was back in this book. Some characters live to the end of the book, but some don't. I actually cried at one point. Kudos to the narrator of the audio version, Jim Dale, for his fantastic work in this series. My rating: 5 Stars.","May 28, 2017"
"9780545010221","3065234","l.","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3065234-l","Reading this for the first time as I abandoned the series after the release of HBP so this review is my liveblog.In no particular order, good things:1. Harry's death scene2. Snape dying at the hands of Voldemort (very appropriate)3. The Dursleys (always good, tbh)4. Draco 5. Kreacher, to a degree. It's a nice idea, but it's profoundly unconvincing.6. Remus guessing that the death eaters knew which Harry was Harry Potter as expelliarmus is seen as Harry's signature move. Hilarious. And true. One of the 5 duelling spells he knows. Terrible things1. The epilogue2. The writing. 'All was well.' 'It is I, Remus J Lupin.' Harry regretting that he will never be 'pierced' by Dumbledore's eyes again. Harry describing Voldemort's eye in a locket as 'handsome' (JKR falling over herself to use the same adjectives over and over again to describe Tom vs Voldemort is really irritating....)3. Voldemort's complete lack of menace and dignity. He's soaring around the skies trying to curse Harry? He's also forgotten that Harry can access his mind - in fact, in this book Harry actually reads Voldemort's thoughts which is something he never could do before and is extremely convenient, to say the least. 4. The long period of time that Harry, Ron and Hermione run around in improbable scenarios, achieving nothing5. The Ron-Harry fallout - it felt completely pasted in as did its resolution - Voldemort sending Ron visions of Harry and Hermione kissing? Really, it underscored what a pathetic sap Ron is - it didn't feel like him overcoming anything, just like him continuing to be a useless, sad sap. Speaking of which 'All's fair in love and war'? Rolling my eyes. Go away, Ron.6. Ron opening the Chamber of Secrets? It's an old bathroom. If random hissing sounds could open the chamber, it would have happened before now.7. The cheap deaths in this book. I call them cheap because they were just pointless sacrifices to underscore that shit was getting real without actually meaning anything or making sense with that character's plotline - apart from Dobby, really. You look at the deaths and a random Weasley, Tonks, Lupin, Ted Tonks, Madeye, Hedgwig? 8. Umbridge's return. So improbable given that she was Fudge's number 2 and no one would want her back & given that her ending in OOTP was actually imo, perfectly resolved.9. The break-in at Gringott's was underwhelming for something that the reader has been anticipating since PS.10. There should have been more dragons. Charlie's whole thing is dragons. Dragons. 11. Voldemort's goals make no sense at all. Even for a megalomaniac. Also his obsession with Hogwarts really makes him a pathetic villain.12. The focus on Dumbledore's backstory - last book it was people trying to reconstruct Voldemort's soap opera of a life and in this book it's Dumbledore, and what a waste of time. Also it's so ridiculous that JKR didn't put Dumbledore's affair with Grindelwald in the book. She had the perfect opportunity to plant even a small suspicion of that with Rita Skeeter's book and chose not to. 13. Percy's comeback made no sense. Percy is the only Weasley I've ever liked and I wanted him obviously to stop being pro-Ministry, but Aberforth became very deus ex machina.14. Everything about Lupin.15. Snape. Enough said.16. That the SPEW plot culminates in Ron and Hermione kissing instead of anything meaningful.17. That Harry is still mediocre and profoundly uninterested in magic. Why doesn't he get better at it? Why doesn't he learn nonverbal magic? When he was going on about how he wanted to meet Snape - lol, last book you couldn't even get out a curse. Come on.18. That at age 17, Harry still cannot recognize people as being complex individuals. He focuses only on his latest perception of them - i.e. for a bit Dumbledore was the worst because he hung out with an evil wizard for two months, nevermind that he's a gazillion years old; and Snape is redeemed for all his sins by his creepy devotion to Harry's mother despite all the fuckery he's been responsible for during Harry's time at Hogwarts and Voldemort attacking him in the first place. Where is your child named after Sirius?19. I cannot believe that there isn't a respectable and notable contingent of Slytherins fighting against Voldemort because despite being traditionalists with their blood purity mumbo jumbo, they don't want to be ruled by an immortal megalomaniac who kills people on whim. How did that not occur to the Malfoys before their involvement, I mean, really. The idea was floated about in GOF briefly but nothing seems to come of it.20. Because Harry was willing to die for EVERYONE, everyone is protected by his love? But he didn't even think that killing himself would save everyone - there was still corporeal Voldemort and Nagini? Ridiculous. It kind of deflates the notion of parental love as well, which I liked.21. Neville should have killed Bellatrix instead of JKR forcing her good femininity vs bad femininity ideas down our throats once again.22. Voldemort's death was absurd. The Elder Wand stuff? What even. And Harry's speechifying ....","Feb 11, 2014"
"9780545010221","216786","Ken-ichi","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216786-ken-ichi","When I first read this book, my only caveat was what I thought of as the protracted, sagging middle of the story, in which the trio travel around the country, trying to figure out what to do without really doing much. They break into the Ministry, they revisit Godric's Hollow, they obtain the sword of Gryffindor, but mostly they just relocate, camp in the woods, and try to interpret the intentions of the dead and departed, or deal with their legacies by interpreting the artifactual evidence they left behind. Regulus and the locket; Grindewald and Dumbledore and the fragments of their story indirectly derived from Belinda Bagshot; Lily's letter to Sirius; the deer patronus; the anonymous missives of support left at the grave of Harry's parents in Godric's Hollow; learning about the DA and the Order through the Potterwatch broadcasts, etc.One example of this was the scene at the Lovegood's, when Harry discovers Luna's private mural of himself, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Ginny, intertwined with a golden ribbon of the word ""friends"" repeated over and over. There were some other important narrative elements introduced in this scene, and some action, but the description of this mural had me tearing up. As I read that passage, Luna transformed from an adorably oblivious but ultimately irrelevant side character to this formerly lonely, abandoned human being for whom the DA's friendship was as novel as it was profoundly essential. And I was actually filled with grief that Harry learned this too late, that this crisis was exposing the unbreakable strength underlying all Harry's friendships too late to acknowledge and cherish those bonds for what they were worth. Except... it wasn't too late, because Luna and many of the others were still alive, and still fighting. So why did I feel like they were dead? This brought to mind a passage from Netherland (which I now feel more inclined to finish):An ancient discovery was now mine to make: to leave is to take nothing less than a mortal action. [...] after Mama's cremation I could not rid myself of the notion that she had been placed in the furnace of memory even when alive and, by extension, that one's dealings with others, ostensibly vital, at a certain point become dealings with the dead.For me, this cast the middle section of the book in a completely new light. Now it became an examination of the way the departed, both dead and alive, continue to touch us and affect our lives through the memories and thoughts they leave behind. In Netherland, O'Neil was pointing out the tragedy of this, how even the living can become as distant from us as the dead, but I think Rowling wants the reader to see this as a profoundly important part of being alive, that seeking out and understanding these kinds of evidence makes bearable the void left by the absent. The influence of the dead is important throughout this book and throughout this series, but in this seemingly humdrum plateau of the novel, I think it becomes paramount.There are lots of other incoherent things I could blather on about, mostly the difference between self-sacrifice and martyrdom and the merits of happy endings, but this review is approaching the edge of ""long"" with ""pointlessly long"" well in sight, so I'll finish. I loved this book as I love the whole series, and its existence has made my life better.","Jul 24, 2007"

Incluso a veces pienso que podría ser mi favorito. La verdad es que podría dividirse la saga en dos partes: una más infantil que abarcaría los tres primeros libros, y otra más oscura, con los cuatro restantes. Mi libro favorito de la parte infantil siempre ha sido El prisionero de Azkaban, pero de la parte oscura me encantan los dos últimos, y en especial Las Reliquias de la Muerte siempre ha tenido algo muy hipnotizante para mí.Es el épico y esperado desenlace de una saga inolvidable en la que no me canso de sumergir mis narices una y otra vez. Es curioso, pero ya no recuerdo las veces que he releído Harry Potter y siempre que lo acabo me quedo vacía. A pesar de las reiteradas relecturas y de no contar ya a estas alturas con el factor sorpresa, siempre, siempre, siempre, cuando paso la última página me sobreviene una severa resaca literaria.En libros anteriores a este vimos ya mucha oscuridad, pero Las Reliquias de la Muerte se lleva el premio gordo. Es un libro serio, triste, solemne, en algunos momentos incluso escalofriante, pero sobre todo, es el libro revelador en el que conocemos la verdad definitiva de tantos enigmas abiertos en libros anteriores. También es una entrega muy diferente a las aventuras precursoras de Harry y sus amigos (y enemigos): en esta novela no les seguimos durante el curso escolar, pues el negro telón de Voldemort ha caído definitivamente sobre el mundo mágico, que se encuentra sometido a su tenebrosa voluntad, mientras Harry y sus seguidores tratan de llevar a cabo una siniestra misión por todo el país, que deben realizar antes de poder acabar con quien-vosotros-sabéis. Si me remonto a mi primera vez con este libro recuerdo lo mucho que me sorprendieron ciertos momentos, lo mucho que lloré con algunas muertes... Y lo sigo haciendo, porque hay cosas que no cambian. Siempre lo he dicho y siempre lo diré: leer y releer a Harry Potter es sentirse en casa, es volver al hogar después de un largo viaje, lo que explica el vacío que queda al acabar estos libros.Pero a pesar del vacío siempre acabo Harry Potter feliz y emocionada, porque, sí, a mí me gusta el final de la saga tanto como el camino. Podéis juzgarme si queréis, no sabéis lo poquísimo que me importa y lo absurdo que encuentro tener que justificarme. Me gusta el final, me gusta el epílogo y me emociona incluso en la película. Soy la rara de turno a quien le encantan las películas de Harry Potter, sí, ¿y qué? En este momento de mi vida ya no procede avergonzarme de ello ni negarlo, sino que me enorgullece, porque así es como soy.Poco más puedo añadir, solo que tengo el presentimiento de que esta no será la última vez que cruce mi camino con el de Mr. Potter.Un saludo,Carol Rodríguez","Jan 03, 2015"

And I'm laughing. And as much as I ""hated"" JKR (I mean, c'mon, who could really hate her?!) at times throughout this series, I love her so much right now! Not to sound completely cliché, but this is seriously THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. Like I said...I laughed. I cried. I sobbed. I gasped. I hated. I screamed. I yelled. In other words, I have NEVER felt so much as I did while I read this book. It takes an amazing author to move me the way that JKR did with not only this book, but this entire series. J.K. Rowling, I must say you have done a fantastic job. I flew through this book. I couldn't put it down. There were times that I honestly doubted JKR throughout this book--I remember thinking: ""Seriously? You're really gonna do this? Do you KNOW what you're doing?"" Well, it wasn't until the ending that I realized she knew (more than any of us could ever have) exactly what she was doing--with amazing results. As a whole, with this series, JKR has created a cast of characters and a world that I know I won't forget anytime soon. Fortunately, I was able to grow up with Harry Potter, so this entire phenomenon that she has created is like home to me, in much the same way that Hogwarts was like a home to Harry. I cannot wait to see what J.K. Rowling comes out with next...I will be eagerly waiting and anticipating...","Jul 01, 2008"

Aside from the fact that it completely transported me away from real life, to the point that people were actually worried about me, it's quite simply a huge accomplishment. It gives a feeling of change throughout the years that makes me feel as if my existence had changed, as if I had been through such life-altering experiences.I've grown with these characters, I've felt what they've felt, I've seen every little change or adventure they've been through, and now that it's over, I feel as if I'd just been ripped apart limb from limb.I'm going to actually be mourning those who have died in this war.","Apr 23, 2013"

Just because I needed to know what happened. Then after a month or so, I re-read it and got more of the book in, something I wasn’t able to do the first time because of my super quick pace.Well I loved it, and I still love it every time I read it. I read the Harry Potters every three of four years, when I feel I’ve forgotten enough about them to enjoy them once more. The only bad thing I can say about this book is that, being it the last in the saga, when I finish it, I feel a bitter disappointment at not having more. It is so good every time that after it, I just need to stay away from every other book for a while because well, nothing is like Harry Potter. If it is your first time reading it, lucky you, my advice to you is take it slow, I know it is impossible, but try to relish every page because at the end of it you won’t get more, sigh. The book has everything: suspense, adventure, struggle, deceit, loss, and most of all retribution!

Mentor goals: Dumbledore.(view spoiler)[However, the name Albus Severes Potter will always bother me because he was not the bravest man Harry knew. Sure, he had the skills to fool Voldemort, but that doesn't discount his actions towards Harry because he expected him to be like is father when he was so much like his mother.

"9780545010221","4324634","Katya","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4324634-katya","Well, it's here folks. The final showdown, at least for me. The final review and the finish to my self-imposed Harry Potter summer challenge. Much like many people, I read the whole series, only in my case, it wasn't in preparation for the movie. Rather, it was me finally coming back to finish what I started ten years ago with these books.And what's the final verdict?It wasn't so bad.*total outrage*Yes, yes, I imagine you expected me to spew venom all over the place, or, maybe you didn't and are now sniggering at my having fallen, once again, under Rowling's spell.To both camps: KEEP YOUR SHORTS ON, I'm not finished.Yes, it wasn't so bad. For instance, we finally, finally, finally see some character development in Harry, and even the Ron/Hermione romance wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. SNAPE! NEVILLE! DRACO! Those three alone are enough of a motivation for anyone to read the series. In fact, I'd like to point them out as examples of how to write good male characters. Alyson Noel, take note!And yes, I was also very much emotionally vested in these characters. I loved all of them, and how wonderfully they interact. I was pleasantly surprised with Percy, who experienced some very impressive character development, as well as Dumbledore, who finally got knocked off his pedestal and was shown, rather, like a character and not some flawless Yoda-like saint. That said, there are shortcomings in this book. In fact, some of its greatest strengths are also its greatest weaknesses.#1 HarryAlright, so we finally get to see the Boy Who Lived to Be a Pain in the Arse to evolve into a character. I loved how Harry grew more responsible in this book, and how he learned that sometimes you have to do what you have to do. My question, though, is this: Why did it take him six and a half books to get there? I know he grows throughout the series, but it's only in this one where he drops the whining and mans up. In a way, throughout the series, he's very much a child, even with all the ordeals he has experienced.#2 Ron/HermioneI still maintain that Hermione is a superior character to both Harry and Ron. I mean, for the love of God, she (view spoiler)[ removes herself from her parents' memories just to keep them safe, and doesn't break down, even when she's being tortured  (hide spoiler)]. Not to mention the dozens of times she has saved everyone's lives, and how she focuses on the bigger picture instead of on her own feelings when the situation calls for it. Rowling really worked on making the romance between Ron and Hermione more believable in this book, but much like Harry, it comes about six and a half books too late. And don't tell me Ron was a prat to her because it's in the character of teenage boys and they bonded through trauma - if that's the case, then explain the epilogue (which I will get to in a minute).#3 DumbledoreSo in book 6 we were seeing the cracks in Dumbledore's saint-like image, but it's not until book 7 that we get a glimpse of the man that he really was. I loved this development, as it showed a lot about his motivation and past.As for the matter of Dumbledore's homesexuality... I admit I was sceptic when I heard it first. Now that I read the book, I think I kinda see it. There is definitely something there, and I can also see it couldn't really be obvious - at the time, it was very unlikely that Dumbledore could have acted on his feelings, and then afterwards... yeah.Now that I read it, I realize Rowling couldn't have elaborated on that aspect of Dumbledore because that's not the point of the series. The point of the series is the power of love and humanity over evil, not the romantic subplots. Although, again, that doesn't fit in with the epilogue, which I will get to... eventually.#4 The Amount of Hammy Deaths in the BookWhere do I begin with this? Okay, you know how Mockingjay is sometimes referred to as 'tragedy porn'? Well, this book borders on it. I mean in the first fifty pages, the owl dies. THE OWL DIES! Right after Harry gives her a nice tour down memory lane. I mean, poor Hedwig![image error] Um, not that one, but... actually... yeah, poor Hedwig. And that's not even the worst of it. The battle for Hogwarts, in its own right, is as horrible as it comes. The deaths of so many wonderful characters (view spoiler)[ Oh, Lupin! Oh, Tonks! Oh, Colin!!! Oh, FRED!  (hide spoiler)] alone are enough to bring tear to the eye. A friend of mine accused me once of wishing some character or another had died in the place of another, and I guess that's not wholly fair because even the most annoying ones shine during the battle. But... some of those deaths were so grisly, and then followed by a moment that was supposed to be... cute? (view spoiler)[ One moment, we have Lavender being savaged by a werewolf, and in the next, Treloni is killing Death Eaters by tossing spheres! What. The. Fuck!  (hide spoiler)] How is this even remotely acceptable? What was Rowling going for with this? I've heard people say that the series grew with the books, but this? Are we trying to write REALISTICALLY here? Because... um...#5 The PlotholesRowling's clearly not squeamish about killing off her characters. And she's not afraid of making the series dark. So why the hell is Harry alive? There was this huge buildup towards a heroic sacrifice which would save the whole world, and then we get this ridiculous cop-out that is so convoluted I'm not even going to try and get in to. Of course, it allows us a whole chapter where Dumbledore's ghost explains everything to our clueless hero, who, instead of letting his feelings run free and telling him to go fuck himself, forgives him nicely and goes back to the land of the living. And so on, and so on. If I went back to explain every plothole of this book, we'd be here till tomorrow. My point is, this victory seems to be based on quite a lot of nice little conveniences. I mean, how nice of Harry to explain how he's won to Voldemort right before he kills him, or that his self-sacrifice (even if he never died) protected the whole frickin' school!#6 The EpilogueHow many people have complained about this? Can't count? Neither can I? So we get this victory which came along through the bloody sacrifice of so many, and then, nineteen years later, our heroes are living the dream, with children and white picket fences? Really?Say what you will about the ending of Mockingjay, but at least it was sensitive to the trauma of war and the horrors the heroes went through. The Deathly Hallows is a tale of pain and loss which ends with an overly cute pink bow on top. Like Severus Lawliet said in her review, where's the emotional scarring? Hermione was tortured in the same manner as Neville's parents. Did Bellatrix just not have enough time to scar her permanently? I realize that all this makes me look like a... rather unpleasant person. Yeah... But I just don't get what Rowling was going for with this book. Did she want the series to grow from one genre to another, like her characters? From a fun children's book to a dark, fantasy epic? Is the story really that realistic? Dragons and goblins and magic aside, I mean. I see the merits of her book. I'm just saying that if she went through the trouble of setting up a tragic ending, maybe she should have gone through with it. So that was the end of my little HP challenge. What do I think of the series as a whole? Decent. I'm sure it'll go down as a children's classic. And, as with most classics, it's best not read too much into it.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go read some happy endings.SnapeLupin and TonksDraco and Hermione","Aug 26, 2011"
"9780545010221","1388090","Jeremy Baker","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1388090-jeremy-baker","I thought that this was a fitting end to the series, though two major weaknesses persist. 1)That most of the book concerns Harry, Ron, and Hermione whining in the forest while the wizarding world burns around them, and 2) Many of the deaths were poorly executed. I don't mind when authors kill off popular characters (I prefer the realism of bittersweet endings), as long as they do it right, and so in that spirit I bring you Harry Potter and the Respectable Body Count:1. Charity Burbage, page twelve.If you don’t recognize her swinging from her heels, naked, over the Malfoy’s dinner table, it’s probably because you skipped over all those muggle studies chapters. Because they weren’t important enough to exist. Not only is the first direct kill of It Who Shall be Last not Voldemorts’ personally, I can’t come up with an appropriate snakes on a plane reference.2. Hedwig, page fifty-six.Flies engulfed in the eerie glow of a bug zapper are accorded more respect in death – at least there’s a glimmer of will in that tiny brain. But as bad as being locked in a cage that also just happens to be in the way of Random Green Curse #1, there are lamer deaths to come.3. Mad-Eye Moody, page fifty-five (or seventy-eight, whatever).Speak of the devil; the most justifiably paranoid survivalist in the Potterverse isn’t ready for a surprise attack? After swallowing whole someone else’s battle plan? From the one guy he had to physically drag along? Why not bring him back during the final charge as a cybernetic half-centaur/house elf, his stolen eye replaced with a gatling plasma cannon? Better or worse than carving a cute little cross over his buried crazy eye?4. Death Eater #1, page fifty-nine.Exploding owl-cage sidecar!!! Note to Chris Columbus: Don’t cut Hedwigs’ Fawkes impression out of the movie.5. Death Eater #2, page sixty-one.Again, Hagrid tackling the guy trying to run him off the sky is cinematic gold, even if the death is merely implied.6. Rufus Scrimgeour etc, page 159.Finally! One of the few ‘good-guys’ we’ve been made to want dead since his first line, dies. Kind of like how Gorman died in Aliens, only without the selfless, redeeming act of heroism slash Alien disposal. Oh, but he didn’t give away Harry’s location while they tortured him. Whoop-de-friggin-do.There were some other ministry blokes there too; I would have enjoyed reading more than one line about it, but I can understand why JK didn’t want to sacrifice a moment of angsty bickering for yet another dreary battle scene.7. Random Muggle Family #1, page 232.A one-dimensional villain can’t go too many pages without slaughtering innocents; the underlings begin to lose respect.8. Gregorovich, page 280.Again, nice that Harry gets to see Voldemort at his most cruel. As opposed to buying groceries, haggling with his insurance adjustor, etc.9. Bathilda Bagshot, page 340.While technically not a ‘death’ she died during the months HHR were wandering in the snow.10. James and Lily Potter, page 344.11. Voldemort, page 345.The first rule of retconning is, you do not talk about retconning. The second rule of retconning is, you do NOT TALK about retconning. To maintain any sense of plausibility you have to bury the groundwork for the end in something the reader already thinks they understand, such as what happened the night Harry got his scar.Michael Frayn’s Copenhagen explores the uncertainty of memory in great detail. How a larger context (WWII) can warp it with equal direction, how difficult it can be for two people to reconstruct the simplest details such as where they walked and for how long. At a minimum the play leaves you with the idea that you can never know something with absolute precision, and that knowing isn’t as important as keeping that awareness in the back of your mind. Worst case, it means I can write whatever I want to fit whatever ending I’ve concocted, and nobody can say I’ve contradicted myself or that I’m just making this nonsense up on the fly, because the facts are in a constant state of distortion.So now Voldemort is Harry, Harry is Voldemort. Whatever. Although it’s one a them ironical sitchialations that James and Lilys’ final moments have been preserved by Voldemort in ways he isn’t aware of.12. Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Gornuk, page 439.This was pointless. Not pointless in the sense that death is very real and pointless sometimes, but in the sense that if you’re only going to give these people a few insignificant lines (We can wander through the woods too! Yay!), I’m not going to care when they die over the radio. Death should, you know, impact the reader in possibly a different way. 13. Peter “Wormtail” Pettigrew, page 471.Draco, is this Harry Potter? Draco, fetch the goblin! What was that noise? Draco! Go check it out, oh, wait, no, we’ll send Wormtail instead. He hasn’t been in the book yet, why not? Yeah, that’s it, Wormtail. Bumbling villians aside though, Wormtail needed to redeem himself in a small way, and then he needed to understand that it was too little, too late. Good job, enjoy your cookie.14. Dobby, page 476.Seriously, JK, this was the best you could come up with? Bellatrix flinging her knife to kill a disapparating house elf, after letting Harry and Co walk all over her and all her lame henchmen, is bullshit.But beyond that, although I can understand how you don’t want Harry or the reader to know that the elder Dumbledore is involved, killing Dobby to safeguard your plot contrivance for less than one hundred more pages is a savage weakness. Dobby and your readership deserved better.15. Nameless goblin # 47, etc, etc. page 549.Sometimes it sucks to be the messenger. Or within the blast radius.16. Crabbe, page #633-ish.Fiendfyre, like exploding owl-cages, will look epic on screen. 17. Fred Weasley, page 637.The Weasleys have too many family members for all of them to survive, but I'm still trying to figure out which twin was which and why I should care.18. Severus Snape, page 658.Finally, the truth. Although I’m not surprised Dumbledore had a plan all along, the extent to which Snape pined for Lily is a bit disturbing. Sweet, but a little stalkerish. Still, you can’t question his devotion or valor. People say there’s no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends, but I say dying is the easy way out. Snape gave up his soul, his bloodline, and his reputation, even after she became Lily Potter, and though it’s sad he had to die, he doesn’t strike me as a person who could ever have been happy with life afterwards. Again, a little twisted, a little predictable, and he didn’t take anyone with him, but still a good death.19. Colin Creevy, page 694.This did surprise me, and thinking about it later made me realize that Rowling really isn’t going to write any more Potter books, as Colin was one of the characters she seemed to be seeding for the future. Though there was a lot for me to hate about HP7 I still enjoyed it immensely, so here’s to going out on top rather than wringing every last drop of blood from your fantasy series until each book is more withered than the last (*cough* Wheel of Time *cough*).20. Harry, page 704.We’ve been wondering about this for years; Will Harry die? Will Voldemort die? Or both? Having it both ways is an old literary cop-out. Meh.21. Nagini, page 733.Enough is Enough!22. Bellatrix Lestrange, page 737.23. Voldemort, page 744.This was a bit overdone.24. Tonks and Lupin, page 745.Worst Deaths ever.","Aug 01, 2008"

So if you have read this review for one book in the series, you have read them all. Interestingly, the age range for YA fiction is actually undefined and rather subjective: varying age ranges from 12 to 18 or 15 to early 20s or 18 to 30.On that note, the Harry Potter series begins at the lower age range and graduates as the series progresses. Much like the young reading audience grows older with each year passing, the books themselves mature in step with it's readership.As an older reader I began reading the much shorter Sorcerer's Stone to my daughters. They quickly progressed and outgrew bedtime stories and soon were reading Harry Potter on their own. To be honest, with my introduction to Harry Potter through my children, I didn't really understand what the fuss was all about.To me, the first few books were not that great (again in the context of an older reader) and I really had to slog through them by myself to try and futilely keep up with my eldest daughter who quickly finished the entire Harry Potter series within a single month. She left me far behind and it took me a year or two to get though the first half of the series. But then it all change, the Harry Potter universe matured, became darker and I was finally hooked. Finally understanding all the hoopla surrounding this series. I don't think there are many authors that can claim to have instilled the love of reading in children as much as J.K. Rowling has. If nothing else matters, the fact that children these days are tearing their eyes away from cellphones and ipads to genuinely reading books again, now that, ladies and gentleman, is the real magic!","Nov 12, 2017"

'is snape good or bad?' 'what if hogwarts burns to the ground and everyone dies?!' and furthermore, 'how long would it take for spoilers to come out in the media and from random mean people?'The book didn't arrive on my doorstep till the following week 'cause I chose free shipping at amazon, but miraculously enough I avoided all spoilers. the ones on my newsletter were easy enough by just scrolling real fast with my hand on the monitor as the thread appeared and disappeared. this easy avoidance of spoilers had me worried the book had no thrills whatsoever. especially reading enough at first to know people liked the book. no one would like if Harry were dead.I was not one of those fast readers who finished it in about one second. no, it took me about four days which is a miracle to me. I fell asleep a lot during the camping phase of the story... well, at least till Harry had to jump in and get the sword and Ron showed back up. that made me loosen up a bit.. become one with the characters again. for awhile, it was just a surface read. see, I also wasn't one of the ones who reread the old books before starting, so I really needed a refresher on some of the lesser characters thus stopped in the midst of reading several times to google this info. at least I read enough threads from those who did read the other books over again, to keep certain clues in mind for the big finale.Towards the end, when things heated up, I got a tad worried for Harry 'cause his death would seem courageous and the whole walking ghosts beside him through the woods bit really brought a tear to my eye.. this would be acceptable to all who read if he died this way, right? I thought about having to walk in (since it was around 6am by this time) with a tear in my eye to say Harry died. this idea sounded pathetic, but c'mon, climatic bit! too early to still be awake and reading! the Dumbledore appearance in 'his head'! (I liked this line most of all: ""Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?"" mom constantly tries to tell me that there isn't a difference between your inner world and your outer world.. what's the difference? what difference would it make if all life were just one big dream? anyway, I won't get too philosophical with this, but beyond what certain people may've thought about how Dumbledore was brought back to talk to Harry -- I had read this wasn't necessary -- I really enjoyed it)So yes, it may've been a bit weak to bring Harry back from possible death, but I'd rather Harry live and get his happy ending than naught. I mean, who would've defeated Voldemort otherwise?One small issue I had--though I am happy I got the Trust Snape sticker at Borders.. I knew better!-- was that Snape wasn't brought to rest at the end. he was just left apparently at Whomping Willow. does this mean he could possibly still be alive? ..the epilogue kind've proves otherwise though. I felt after all he did, he deserves more respect than just to have a namesake. I felt the most compassion for him during 'The Prince's Tale' chapter especially.Beyond that, I didn't regret reading it (since I didn't really have any real wants and needs beyond the quality of the writing) or throw it across the room as apparently some people did (wtf?). one day I'll reread all the books again since I hear it's fun to see how connected they all really are. I think that's brilliant. this is the best children's / YA series I've ever had the chance of reading and am glad I picked it up when I did even if I didn't grow up with Harry.","Aug 12, 2007"

  I wasn’t prepared
I’ve known for a long time which characters die (Tumblr has spoilers everywhere when your a billion years behind everyone else). I thought I would be braced for the emotional turmoil. HAHAHAHAHAHA WHO WAS I KIDDING! In some ways I think knowing who died but not when or how made it worse. There were so many feels and deaths and intense fights.
  Everyone is grey
One of my favourite parts of DEATHLY HALLOWS was learning more about Dumbledore and Snape and their pasts. I love how it made them more grey, not simply good and evil. It made them more real, more complex, more questionable and admirable.
  My favourite book of the series
This book had everything I’ve been waiting for since book one. Minimal romantic angst, intensity and fast pacing from the first chapter. I could barely put it down, especially once the Battle of Hogwarts began. There was so much plot, so many answers, so many epic fight scenes and feels.
  What do I do now?
I’m kind of lost. I can’t believe I’ve finished this series, and I only started it in January this year. It’s weird that it’s over. If I feel like this after only six months, how did those of you who grew up with Harry and the gang ever recover?
  I cannot wait to reread them
This is a series I will revisit again one day. I want to read them in physical form and find all the little clues and foreshadowing I missed this first time round. And I expect it will be just as magical the next time round.
  In Summary
HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS was my favourite Harry Potter book. So much plot, so much action, so little romantic angst. I loved it.","Jun 26, 2016"

There's nothing I could have said that almost everybody doesn't know. But also, I was part of that almost up until now.Anyway, I started reading this series for a bunch of reasons, most of them obvious but also there was this sort of question on the back of my head: Can somebody be 17 and still like a middle-grade intended book series? It's tied with a lot of people's childhood or first read series and I have read a bunch of series by now and yeah, I loved it but I'm not gonna be like ""I misss it so much"" because I just read it.Because also I read Chronicles of Narnia last year and  I hated it. It's older and it has many different things with HP but it's like one of those series. The characters were so stupid, seriously but instead in this series I found flawed, heart-warming, hard-not-to-love characters. That's probably why I loved it the most because J.K rowling really gave some reality to her characters and understood them.It was better than I expected-- even though my expectations were high--- but one thing I didn't expect was 1) That I wouldn't like the movies as much after it. It just never went through my head.2) That I'd be shipping Ron and Hermione and Harry and Ginny. When I saw the last movie and saw that Ron and Hermione kiss it was a big WTF for me, it was like out of nowhere in my head. it makes more sense when you read the books but you didn't see it that much on the movies. I was like: But Harry and Hermione...? (There's like nothing between them in the books.) I didn't mind Harry and Ginny that much but now I just really ship them.There are probably more things I'd like to say about it but I just can't think of anything right now but it was as good as promised.","Jun 05, 2015"

August 1st 2007 I was 22 years old and finishing up my summer courses so I could graduate early. I had recently broken up with a long term boyfriend, was living with roommates, and was on the verge of throwing out everything I owned and taking my dog and my backpack on an adventure. I was on the cusp of a great change, one I somewhat understood and equally couldn't begin to understand. It is only now that many years has past that I can see that was when I chose my path on the kind of life I wanted to lead: one based on fear or one motivated by a challenge. I have a distinct memory of being absolutely wrecked when I read this the first time and I reread it immediately after I finished. There was something about Neville's journey most of all that spoke to me and was reflected in my life at the time but I struggled putting it all together. It is only now that I have reread this series in it's entirety as an adult that it became clear. We are a sum of our choices. No matter what events unfold in our journey ultimately we are in charge of the outcome, to be true to our moral fiber, and to continue to live an inspired life on your terms. I'm not going to talk about this book, there is nothing I can say that has not been said a thousand times over. I will simply suggest that if you find yourself on the cusp of a great change and are hesitant to take the next steps, please remember:","Jul 07, 2013"

Nothing I say will be new or enlightening. I'm keeping this short and sweet. I felt a whole gamut of emotions in this final installment. Lots of puzzle pieces fell into place.

She makes you feel for them. She makes you love Snape even though he's really a jerk. (You can't tell me he didn't put that sword in ice on purpose just to make Harry extra miserable.) She redeems the Malfoys. Unfortunately she makes you love so many characters and then cruelly kills them. No one is safe.

The shortest explanation I can give is a quote from one of my favourite books, which someone added pretty spot-on gifs to, so it would be a shame not to share it ^^ (*I take no credit)""It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.The ones that really mattered.Full of darkness and danger they were.And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.Because how could the end be happy?How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow.[image error]Even darkness must pass.A new day will come.And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.Those were the stories that stayed with you.That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why.But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back,only they didn't.they kept goingBecause they were holding on to something...There's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.And it's worth fighting for.""It's over. And I feel empty. Hogwarts it truly my home. This story is a precious part of me, as real as any other experience. I believe it will stay with me forever. It's not perfect, of course it's not, but to us that grew up alongside those characters it's special.If you wish to read some of my random thoughts on this book, go there: http://anhec.booklikes.com/post/75043...Here I'll mention only two things.Neville: that one is beyond words. I think there's a bit of Neville living in each one of us. He's a true underdog of the story. He's scared, full of doubts, doesn't believe in himself, tries to meet the expectations of family and teachers, but always falls short. He can never quite measure up. Always insecure, always struggling. And yet he knows the difference between right and wrong and is willing to fight for it. To die for it. He knows who he is, who he wants to be. He finds his strength, he finds passion, he finds what he's good at and makes friends. The way he wasn't willing to compromise and stood up to his friends (after risking first a lot to warn them) is commendable. That is something Lupin didn't know how to do. He's got what young Dumbledor was missing. Ron, George, Harry... they all lose the sight of their goal, of priorities upon witnessing death and tragedy. What does Neville do? What Harry asked him to. He stands up to Voldemort and in this precarious situation, with a burning hat on his head, when he's about to die, he kills the snake. He decides to do what Harry asked him to do even if it's the last thing he'll do in his life, even though he has no idea why was it important at all. Harry wanted to know, needed to know 'why'. He felt entitled to this knowledge.The more I think about Neville the more I love and admire him. ""In a world of leaders and followers, there are some who don’t attempt to fit either mold, and it is those distinct few who really determine the future of us all. That is what Neville Longbottom can teach us.""Snape: do I even have to tell you? He isn't a good guy - he's an asshole with serious anger management problems. Does he love Lily? Yes and no, he's kind of obsessed, but she always represented something good in his life. It's not empty. Is he, as a young man, compassionate at all? Pff, nope. Does he change completely? NO! He hates Harry! To the very end! He's not angry abut the boy dying, but about feeling cheated out of his purpose in life! Something he was holding on to. Or is he? We never truly know! We don't ever learn the whole truth about him; we can only guess and assume. This is one of the most wonderfully complex characters I've ever encountered. You kind of hate him, but also admire his determination and dedication. Not to mention - you feel sorry for him, sorry for a boy that grew emotionally far, far too late. But in his twisted way he cared, he cared about the Order of the Phoenix, he cared about Dumbledore, he cared about the difference between right and wrong (after years of growing and changing, but still, he got there). What he did... It's beyond comprehension. Harry was ready to die, but before that he had lived. People knew him, loved him. Snape gave up EVERYTHING, ended up alone and despised, carrying great responsibility on his shoulders. I hope the extent of Snape's sacrifice was appreciated in the end. I really do.","May 30, 2013"
"9780545010221","37026645","Matt Smith","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37026645-matt-smith","There's a line in Firefly. The crew is going to rescue Mal from Niska. Wash is piloting Serenity into Niska's space station. Zoe describes it as ""hitting a bullseye six thousand miles away.""More than not, this is how I always think about endings. When you begin, you fire the shot, and when it ends you hope that it lands exactly where you want it to. The more complex the story, the more complex it becomes to hitting a bullseye. And ending a single novel is hard. Giving it a suitable ending and a fantastic climax is really, really difficult. Now add two novels to that. Now you need four endings, a suitable ending for each novel and an ending for all three collectively. And doing that is really hard. Suzanne Collins couldn't do it. Veronica Roth sure as shit couldn't do it.And it's hard for a TV show. I'm a massive LOST fan, and I think hitting that ending as hard as they did, from as far away as they did, is next level writing. They had entire elements of the show they couldn't use (Mr. Eko is the best example), things that couldn't happen, plans that 100% changed and meant guessing at a different version of their already guessed ending.And it's hard for this, the final(ish) installment of the Harry Potter series. Seven books. Minimum eight endings (I'd argue it's nine ...). Tons of characters to say goodbye to... a gigantic mythology to wrap up.... And Rowling, being the insanely ambitious, amazing writer that she is, basically goes completely off the reservation here. Hogwarts doesn't show up until the third act. The entire middle of the book is essentially a camping trip around England. The first act (even from page one) shifts the entire book into a status quo none of us really, actually, truly anticipated. AND THEN halfway through the she goes and introduces a completely new branch of the mythology around which the whole climax of the novel pivots.It is, to say, the sort of thing that probably shouldn't work. I love how much the last installment is the ""light-it-on-fire, go-for-broke"" installment, but this is literally the stuff of absolute legend. And Rowling pulls it off. She pulls it off she pulls it off she pulls it off with finesse and grace, giving the ultimate capstone to what is probably the single most influential storytelling event in western pop culture since Star Wars.It is, to put it simply, basically perfect.It's hard to describe how much I love this book. I adore this book. If I had to pick a Harry Potter book that best shows off why I love the series, this would be it. It's a fucking masterpiece. Watching all of the elements come back once again (noticing every single nostalgia reference is easier once you've had time to absorb it for a while), seeing her weave and out in a victory lap tour of the series, seeing how well she treats every single character who she could possibly squeeze into this book, the continued awfulness of Umbridge, the redemption of Percy, the delicateness with which she treats Severus Snape, the coming-around of Dudley, the hubris of Voldemort.... It is.... so perfect.Truly, this is the book that has everything, only let down by the fact that Harry and his friends don't go to Hogwarts for another year. But after Half-Blood Prince what is there left to do at Hogwarts? How would they be expected to defeat a fully empowered adult wizard without acting like fully empowered and independent adults? It has two massive heist sequences, a thrilling as all hell chase scene, a chapter that's basically as taut a thriller as I've ever seen her write (Malfoy Manor), one of the best extended flashback sequences I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing, a brand new mythology that it's easy to forget SHE MADE UP FROM SCRATCH (Three Brothers), a massive war story on the Hogwarts grounds.... It has the origin story of Albus Dumbledore (providing the layers to his character that make him my favorite character in the series)... It has the best thing J.K. Rowling has ever written (The Forest Again).It is a novel about generational divides, a beacon of progress and humanity, a statement that the old must pass that the new might inherit the earth, because whatever current generation is on top can't save the world. All things change and evolve. The world can only be saved and shaped by those who will inherit it. The last image is of even the next generation who will take over once Harry and his friends are done and dusted.Deathly Hallows is about the best thing you could hope for at the end of a series. It has heartbreak, it has laughs, it has moments of sheer badassery, it has entire chapters that makes us all weep. It is devastating, it is empowering, it sees Harry torn to his utter lowest point and then built up into the hero we all knew he would eventually become. It is massive and epic and yet impossibly small and understated, with gigantic moments flying by as personal and quick in the blink of an eye and feeling impossibly mythic just a few pages later. It ends with a magic trick and its ultimate victory is unabashedly a celebration (and bittersweet) but undeniable in its euphoria.It is perfect children's literature. It is everything I could possibly want from an ending or final installment. And it only gets better every single time, which, in a final installment, shouldn't happen.

Harry Potter: Deathly HallowsI think my resolution of the year would be to stop whining about my job and just live by what it has to offer instead and work my ass off here with all my readers and pals!Hi, How are you guys? I have bee avoiding writing/ reading books and just when it hit me- I ONLY READ 57 books, I was shattered. (Trust me it isn't a lot, at least not to the number of books I purchased this year.)Anywho. Here today we are talking about Deathly Hallows which I read 2 months back. I AM WAAYYYY TOO SLOWWW.I am a snail and I have got to recollect my thoughts as to talk about the book not that people don't know what the book is, or have read reviews about it already? haha!It is taken for granted that everyone and anyone know about Harry Potter and people who don't like Harry Potter- well, I don't want to know you, people.Oh-- I am a Slytherin-- So you know if you disagree with me or anything else.......I don't want to put it into words but BAD Things can happen.Wheeeeeere do I even start with this? WHERE.Controversial statement. I love this book, I do. I love Harry Potter but I didn't like this book as much as Goblet of fire. Even though it has more of Dumbledore, one person we all want to know more about. Yet.I kind of have some issues, not a lot but some- I gave it 5 stars, clearly, those issues aren't a big deal. xD But because I am not going to stop whining until I speak of them..so.MY ISSUES, MY WRATH, THE REASON WHICH IS WHY I WAS SO SLOW.I just like to be dramatic with my headlines.THE PACING.The pacing is ridiculous. Seriously, it was like oh now that we don’t have any homework and Draco bothering us with his petty issues, we will create some random problems and misleading adventures. NOT FUN, I was bored. I wanted to kill Voldemort in the first 5 pages itself. Yeah and then I would have cribbed about how small the book was.Maybe it’s not the author’s fault at all, maybe it’s me, maybe’s that’s who I am as a person!No wait, the pacing was slow anyhow picks up fine and then we go on a roller coaster ride for our life.HATE SLYTHERINS?Why are we the baddies always? yeah yeah, I know in the end Harry Potter defends us and all.. but has it changed anybody’s perception? Is there anyone from Slytherin who is good, who we consider good? Please do not talk about Snape to me. No. Other than that tell me! Tell me!Am I wrong? Huh? Don’t call me a baddie- I will come and slit your throat off and then laugh like Bellatrix.WHY IS DUMBELDORE SO SECRETIVE? I NEED MORE.I encourage good characters, with good storylines, with back stories with so much detail that we are able to have theories and all that. BUT, DUMBLEDORE? OH, MY GOD? You really can’t tell anything about him, do you? We respect him and all but do we really know him? Harry wasn’t alone in all of this, I was there with him too and I felt bad about all of it.I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT DUMBLEDORE, his life, his work, his secrets. That is one thing which wasn’t given to us properly and it bugs me as well as intrigues me, SO SO SO VERY MUCH.I will appreciate if I am given 10 volumes on Dumbledore asap. Thank you very much.OTHER CHARACTERS? I WANT MORE OF THEM.I wish and hope we had more of the twins.More of Ginny.More of Luna.More of Neville.Actually, more of other characters because they deserve it.(Low key demanding more pages in the book) HARRY IS A GRUMPY CAT.After book 5, Harry is so grumpy all the time, UUGGHHH- I dislike him more than Ron at times, Jesus.Anywho he is back to his normal self towards the end. I would have died if you wouldn’t have.MY LOVE, MY LIGHT, AND EVERYTHING ELSE GOOD.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENTS? OH MY GOD.THE PLOT TWIST?It’s clever.The revelations, the build it’s clever, honest and beautiful.THE DECEIT–And by that I mean the characters, the story the way J.K. Rowling wants us to think but then parallelly show goes like peek-a-boo.I was in awe of that.THE INTRICATE STORY BUILDINGWho can build a world like that? Characters in depth like that? With not only just back stories but family history, place history and what not, we have everything (except Dumbledore and I are sure she has a lot of stories there to tell us).Clearly, a lot of time, effort and patience have gone in and I applaud it.THE CHARACTERS ARE GORGEOUS- EACH ONE OF THEM DESERVES A BOOK FOR THEMSELVES.Don’t you agree? We know so many of them and we know them as f we met them, that’s how brilliantly it is done.I AM A SADIST- BUT THE DEATHS <3- THEY ARE BOLD AND GOOD.I have read books, great books.What I have noticed is- until and unless we see death, we really do not appreciate the fight, the support and hard work we have put in. Until and unless we are made to think of what we have lost, it feels pointless. (Wow, I sound like a schmuck.) But don’t you agree? If everyone lived, every good character- what was even the point?And.. that’s all. Can there be something else to talk about?Everything is great, everything is awesome, everything makes sense. Only thing is I want more of this comforting world (It’s weird because in all the stories we are losing someone or the another and yet we find love, peace and comfort here.)Let me know your thoughts and feelings in the comments down below.Buy Harry potter here.Which part is your favourite? Which scene is your favourite? Which character is your favourite?RATING- 5/5 STARS.","Oct 25, 2017"

"9780545010221","2314907","Melissa Jackson","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2314907-melissa-jackson","I finally finished the Harry Potter series. I guess I shouldn't say finally-- when I bemoaned how long it took me to read the 7 book series (2 months), people reacted with incredulous remarks of how that was not a long time to take. I guess it just felt like it. I loved the books so much, always wanted to read them (I liked them the way you do when a book is just delicious. You think about it when you can't read it and nothing brings you more satisfaction than to finally unlatch your brain and crawl in the story at the end of the day...sigh. Is this just me? It can't be.), and considering how easy the first several books in the series were, it just felt like forever. A measly nothing compared to some friends of mine who, from H.P. onset, had to wait a year between each book. Sometimes more-- one friend took 8 years to complete the series due to the epidemic we Bibliophile's refer to as ""release waiting"".I loved this book best of all. It showed Harry's dark and light, with more balance than the previous books. Harry was what you wanted and expected him to be. A friend whose personality you knew well and could predict. That was the other fun part of Deathly Hallows, being able to predict with authority different mysteries along the way, just from your absorption in each character and the different spells and places and names that seemed alive-- you know your magic if you've made it this far. JKR is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Every little detail is important. Everything. In a way that leaves no stone unturned, but not in a irritating fashion. It's concise. It grabs you and it feels real.The last 100 pages were almost agonizing in their emotional force. The book was immediately on a whole different level than all the editions before. I am talking 2nd. page into the book, it was darker and more intense-- a higher level of writing, a deeper level of what you knew was coming from the beginning. A terrible cost. Even JKR's vocabulary choices. It's elevated and therefor all the more impacting. Voldemort comes into his full stride, completing his ultimate symbolism of the dark side of man and the spirit, and it is terrifying. These characters that you feel you know are in life or death situations for over 700 pages. It's utterly gripping.I felt like I had said goodbye to an old friend at the end. That's always a good thing for a reader.Yeah, it's a young adult story. Clearly. But it has a wonderful message and unbelievably inspiring characters and situations that teach lessons that all ages could do well to heed.I treasure my books. If you've been to my house, you know this. If you went in my room as a kid or teenager, you'd know this. My life has been surrounded with books. Rarely loaned and often cleaned, they fill my home. I have Harry Potter sitting beneath my fireplace, in the center of my living room. Just to make sure I can keep an eye on them.""Would I?"" asked Dumbledore heavily. ""I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find their own surprise that they wear it well.""","May 10, 2010"

This is different from all the other books as the war has been lost and Hogwarts is not the main setting of the story. While this is the most adult book in the series, the series does still feel innocent especially as the characters do not think like most teenagers. These books have all been about how love triumphs all and that death is not the end but the beginning of a new story. Unfortunately, it was obvious that the Deathly Hallows were added just to this book as there was no references to them in previous books unlike the Horcruxes. One thing I have never liked in this series is the labelling of Slytherin students as evil, as just because they are cunning and ambitious does not mean they will all turn into Death Eaters. Is it bad that I was more upset over Hedwig dying than Moody’s death?I always felt that Harry should have died at the end of this series for two reasons, firstly then Rowling would not have been pressured to write more in the series, and secondly it felt like Harry’s entire life was destined to stopping Voldemort and, like Frodo in The Lord of the Rings, I am not sure he would have been able to move and carry on with his life without a purpose. I also really liked Neville’s development over the series as he has gained confidence and has become the person he was meant to be.I love Ron and Hermione’s relationship and when I first read this book when I was younger, I was hoping that they would end up together but now I feel that with the amount of time they spent together without acting on their feelings they would have been stuck in the friend zone. Snape is one of the most interesting and complex characters and I loved learning more about his past. I also liked hearing about Dumbledore’s darker past which I feels humanises him. I guessed what was going to happen to Lupin and Tonks in this book after Harry was named Godfather, as I could tell that Ted’s situation would mirror Harry’s. When I first read this series I thought the ending would have been about Hogwarts and maybe Harry and Voldemort’s links to the houses or that Neville was actually the chosen one. After I finished this book when it originally came out I felt like my childhood had ended as I had grown up with these characters and even now 8 years later I also got the same feeling. I would recommend the entire Harry Potter series to everyone, even those who have watched the films as they don’t have the magic of the books. All was well.

I arrived late evening and spent the next 7 hours with people of all ages and nationalities, all enamoured with Rowling's characters. It was absolutely brilliant!!!!!So, anyway, what about the book? Following on from the Half-Blood Prince, this last instalment is full of action, suspense, revelations and battles. It is war, after all. Some people do the right thing for the wrong reason, or indeed the wrong thing for the right one. Many scenes echo the ones seen in the Philosopher’s Stone, with visits to Diagon Alley, Gringots Bank, the Sorting Hat, Olivander, the four school Houses, Hogwarts’s Ghosts, etc. Our trio has a hard time finding out what to do - which items did Voldemort choose for his Horcruxes and where could they be? And what are the Deathly Hallows? - but that just made it more believable.The characterisation was spot on, not just for our group, but also for Dumbledore, who comes across as being much more complex (and flawed) than imagined. Our favourite teachers are still there and we finally find out Snape’s secret. And Neville, my favourite secondary character, shows his mettle and shines! His gran appears here too and what a spunky sight she is!A word about Molly Weasley as promised. I loved that Rowling went against the stereotype of making her ‘weak' as would be suggested by her motherly behaviour. In fact, Molly is one hell of a strong witch as becomes apparent in this book, and which was hinted in the series by the many parallels shown with Ginny. It seems the girls ‘have' it in the Weasley family. In fact, Rowling tackles quite a few roles. In her universe, it is ok to be intelligent, love books and the library, or be the funny sidekick, or the shy one, or the slightly weird one. Courage comes in many guises and can be found in the seemingly most unlikely places. Finally, I truly love this series and shall keep coming back to it, again and again, to loose myself in this incredible and amazing universe full of beloved characters. Although I haven’t given all the books the maximum score, the series as a whole definitely deserves the 5 stars :O)","Aug 30, 2012"

Creo que nunca he sufrido tanto con un libro, puede también que no estoy acostumbrada a leer historias donde los personajes caen como moscas, y la verdad, no me gusta mucho, porque me encariño mucho con ellos y luego duele, jo. Pero tengo que ponerle un pequeño “pero” … Y es cuando pasan tanto tiempo buscando los Horrocruxes, admito que esta parte se me ha hecho un pelín pesada porque sentía que la historia no avanzaba. Pero bueno, es un pero sin mucha importancia porque lo que viene después… mamá mía, no tienes tiempo ni para respirar de tanta tensión. En resumen, me ha encantado mucho la saga y he de reconocer que me arrepiento mucho de no haberla leído en su día porque la hubiera disfrutado muchísimo más, ahora me ha pillado un poco más mayor, pero aun así la he disfrutado mucho y por fin puedo decir tan feliz de la vida: ""Me he leído Harry Potter"". Y por cierto, estoy deseando leer Harry Potter y el legado maldito, pero lo voy a dejar para el año que viene… Necesito darle tiempo a este final y asimilarlo.","Dec 12, 2016"

That said, this is the first time I felt strange after finishing a Harry Potter book. Once I had finished crying, it dawned on me how very unlike the other books it was. Maybe it's because it's the only one I haven't read 2-10 times, but it felt unfamiliar. I think it was probably the lack of Hogwarts. The school was such a big part of the books, it was weird for this book to take place elsewhere. In the end, I was happy with how everything went. I don't think it would be possible to please everybody, but after a decade of writing, J.K. wrote a marvellous ending to the series, despite the fact Harry named one of his children (view spoiler)[Albus Severus. (hide spoiler)]Whenever I think back to my childhood/adolescence, I will think of Harry Potter, and the wonderfully fond memories I have of him. Thanks, J.K.","Feb 19, 2010"

Gone are so many amazing characters that I loved so much.. I feel as though a giant Hogwarts-shaped hole has been left in my heart by completing this series. It was a ride I started in January, and what a ride it was! This world is unlike anything I've ever read about before, and I am going to miss it so much (though of course I'll revisit it as often as I can!).The characters are going to stick with me for a long time as well, their bravery and humor and wisdom and, in some cases, their sacrifice.. I feel as though I've lost dear friends, and I shed many tears as I finished their story. But that's the joy of a book; these friends can be visited again and again! I hope to watch all of the movies soon, too, and to visit Orlando so I can see Hogwarts up on the hill, and Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley..Thank you, JK, for this amazing journey.

My face is swollen and my heart is aching. Even though this must be near my 15th reread of the series, I simply cannot avoid feeling the same sense of awe and wonder and utter devotion as the very first time I had to face the last pages of a world, in which I had become so entangled. To close this book, to stroke its back cover, will for ever more be an action of both utterly and entire admiration and bitter sweet remorse that it has all ended. I can do nothing but let myself reread these words of wonder and wisdom again and again and allow myself to be swept of my feet repeatedly, allow myself to be overwhelmed by all these feelings that I have never ever encountered in any other book in all my life. No book as the Harry Potter series affects me this thoroughly, and I expect - with both joy and regret - that none ever will.","May 01, 2013"

"9780439023481","4074594","Kiki","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4074594-kiki","I have got to stop poking fun at this series with memes. Someone take them away from me!Nah, I didn't love this book. I know I'm in the minority, and part of me is glad about that. I mean it when I say this book deserves recognition, and honestly, I'd rather people were reading this and following a heroine as independent as Katniss, rather than a simp like Bella or Bethany. The Hunger Games is high-quality YA, intelligently written, and despite its flaws it's worthy of success. Here's where I become one of those lone rangers on a forum uttering the forbidden words: Battle Royale. Stop! Put down the pitchforks! Let me make my point, okay?At the risk of sounding like Hipster Mermaid, I read BR and watched the movie long before I discovered THG. So the second I read the synopsis, the first thought that popped into my head was, ""Sounds a lot like Battle Royale!""It reads a lot like BR, too. I'm sorry, THG fans; but you can literally pair up characters from this book and fit them snugly into the moulds of those from BR. Katniss is Nanahara, Peeta is Noriko, Cato is Kazuo Kiriyama (he even volunteered, just like the Careers!), President Snow is the guy played by Beat Takeshi, Effie is the bouncy girl from the training video, Clove is Mitsuko...the list goes on.I know, people. I know Suzanne Collins said she hasn't read BR. I find this hard to believe, given the similarities, but to each her own. The above is simply something that really, really stuck out to me. The entire way through, I was finding similarities. This isn't to say The Hunger Games doesn't follow its own course, and have its own storyline. It does. But think of the people who lash out at Cassandra Clare because of the similarities between her work and J.K. Rowling's. If you're one of the people who feels angry about that, consider that perhaps the people who read BR, then THG, and noticed the same glaring similarities as I might feel the same way. I am not a Harry Potter fan, thus I don't know what the comparisons are between the Mortal Instruments and the Harry Potter books - but I did read both BR and THG, and personally, I came across many similarities that I could not overlook.Moving on, the romance. The romance in this book drove me insane. I don't understand what the constant need to have a love triangle is, but people who say, ""There are no teams!"" are just kidding themselves. If there were never meant to be teams, and if this book didn't want to have ""just another love triangle"" ... then it shouldn't have had ""just another love triangle"". That's the way it is, I'm afraid. I am absolutely and utterly sick of love triangles, and what was worse about this one was the second I read Peeta's name and his history with Katniss, I knew it was going to be all about Katniss loving Peeta and Gale trying to muscle in. It was predictable, and a Plot Tumor. Think of how amazing this book could have been had there been no romance, or if Katniss had actually been forced to kill Peeta. I literally waited, with baited breath, for Katniss to kill Peeta. But she didn't. Convenience saved her.The synopsis of this book suggests that Katniss's humanity will be questioned, and she will be forced to make agonizing decisions in the name of her survival, but never once does she kill for the sake of herself. Every kill she makes is either in mercy, accidental or in lieu of child murder (Marvel's death was carried out after he speared Rue; Katniss's killing him would then play out as comeuppance rather than Katniss killing for the sake of herself). Katniss's hands remain proverbially clean, the whole way through the Games. This is simply not what I signed up for. It's unrealistic, to begin with. Biologically, the human body and mind is wired for survival at all costs. It's true. Think about it: when someone develops dementia, the mind literally breaks down to nothing. Why, then, does the body not simply give up? Why doesn't it shut down, because the mind no longer works? Survival. Survival is why. The main objective of life is to do exactly that: live it. Animals exhibit this to a tee. Smaller animals have faster heartbeats than larger animals, because the lower down they are in the food chain, the more ready they are always required to be to rely on flight to escape predators. This is why Katniss's lily-white innocence remaining intact until the end irks me. She never has to make any difficult decisions. She is never forced to wrestle with her humanity, give up her principles, shame herself in front of the people who love her who must watch her participate. She is unabashedly perfect. Her inability to make friends doesn't even factor in; everyone immediately adores her regardless. People are willing to die for her, for heaven's sake. The Capitol practically eats the dirt she walks on. And this doesn't change over the course of the series. I like flaws, man. What can I say? Perfection doesn't interest me. Innocence doesn't interest me, especially in a dystopian setting, where brutality is law-enforced. It just doesn't convince me, is all. Having said all that, I simply cannot fault Collins' amazing ability to build suspense. I'll put a pin in the excruciatingly boring first 140 pages, and say that the portion of this book that featured the actual Games was just thrilling. The prose was sparse, with the feeling of unedited thought; I love that. A lot of people don't, but I do. Actually, come to think of it, Collins' writing was stellar overall. I'm a huge fan of first person present tense, especially during snappy and gripping action scenes, of which this book had many. Honestly? These books just piss me off. I don't know what it is. The setting was smart and well-drawn, the anti-violence message was clear and good, and despite being a constant annoyance, Katniss was a fiercely independent and capable female character. This I greatly appreciate. It's not a bad book, by any means, but I'm just not a fan of it.Aside: I have to laugh, kittens, because a lot of people need to crack open a history book before they make wild claims about the form of government going on here. Numero uno: the government system is not fascist. Please, don't say that it is. It just isn't. At all. It also isn't Marxist, either. I'm not a fan of Marx or his boyfriend Frederick, but don't shame the man and his gratuitous beard. It's more like a very obscure form of Stalinism (but without the weird foreign policy).In fandoms like this, the naysayers are never without backlash. I've run into a fair few people who scream about how insane I am for not being in all-consuming love with this book (as if three stars is suddenly a bad rating!). Honestly, I don't really care if you loved the book. Sure, if you did, that's great. It's brilliant when people can enjoy the written word, and this book is not terrible, I did not hate it, and if I had never read any dystopian before it I would probably lobotomy-fangirl over it until I died. But right now it isn't for me.Another aside: I ended up reading CF in full because a friend forced me to. I don't know what was different the second time around, but when I gave it another try I realized that book is outstanding. Definitely the best in the series. Far better than this one, and let's only refer to the last book from now on as Dat Flop. In fact, let's not refer to it at all. Let's pretend it never happened. I beg of you all.I tried hard to jump on this bandwagon, but in all honesty, I just don't really have any passionate feelings for this series. Comprende?Bonus Time!Look, I'm sorry. But I had to do it.","Mar 15, 2011"

"9780439023481","4527753","Khanh (the meanie)","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-the-meanie","I was forced into watching Mockingjay: Part II this weekend. To clarify, I watched the second part of the last Hunger Games movie without having read any of the books, without having watched any of the movies.Needless to say, I was confused as fuck.So many questions and thoughts ran through my mind as I watched the movie. Why is Peeta so thin? Did that huge-ass bruise really disappear from her neck the next day? Is Katniss supposed to look like she's about to burst into tears at any given moment, or is that just Jennifer Lawrence? Woody Harrelson is in this movie? Hey, it's Margaery from Game of Thrones! Who's President Snow? What's a Mockingjay? Lesser Hemsworth is pretty hot.Well, you get the point. I know how the book ended and I still have no idea who anyone is, and neither do I know their names, with the exception of Peeta, Gale, President Snow, that Coin woman, and Katniss. Of course, knowing how the book ended means I probably should read the first book, so here I am, the last person on earth to read The Hunger Games.And it was good. It was really good. My sister was right (she usually is).What else can I say that hasn't already been said? I loved it. The world building was interesting (although it helps that I've seen what it looks like on the big screen), and Katniss is awesome. One of the things my sister didn't like about the first movie is that the on-screen Katniss was different from her portrayal in the first book. I haven't watched that movie, but I kind of see how the screen portrayal of Katniss might have bothered her. Book-Katniss is strong, kick-ass without being a Mary Sue. She has a fierce love for her sister, and she is manipulative and cunning. She uses the prospect of romance to protect herself, she has no qualms about using people, and I love that about her.Time to watch Movie #1!","Nov 23, 2015"
"9780439023481","3672777","Nataliya","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya","Suzanne Collins has balls ovaries of steel to make us willingly cheer for a teenage girl to kill other children. In a YA book. Two reasons why this book rocks: (a) It is not Twilight, and (b) I really hate reality shows. 
  Seriously, how long would it take for reality shows to evolve from ""Survivor"" to ""Hunger Games""? 
Yes, this book is full of imperfections. It often requires a strenuous suspension of disbelief. It can cause a painful amount of eye-rolling and shaking fist at the book pages. Its style is choppy and the first-person present tense gets annoying. The story is simple, and the message is heavy-handed. But is does set a better example for young impressionable pre-teens than gushing stories about sparkly co-dependency. And here is an obligatory taken out of contest Twilight-bashing quote: 
  “But just the fact that he was sparkling leads me to doubt everything that happened.” 
 So why did I add it to my to-read list for my future (hypothetical) daughter? Because Katniss is cool and a badass. She is fierce, independent, resourceful, intelligent, and skilled. She is loyal to her friends and family. She is a survivor. She will never allow a guy to carry her around as though she is a delicate flower. She skewers that apple in the pig's mouth with an arrow in front of the Gamemakers in the most awesome way imaginable. For all that, I love this imperfect, surly, prickly, sullen and perpetually pissed-off, quick to jump to judgment, and sometimes clueless girl. And I love this book because - despite The Hunger Games being YA literature that seems to hinge on the romantic puppy love - the happiness of Katniss does not revolve solely around a cute male lead. Yes, there is a (hated) love triangle here *eyeroll* but there are other issues that occupy Katniss' mind - such as the survival of her friends, family, and herself rather than just pining over a cute boy. (*)
   * Unlike other so-called ""books"", where a boyfriend of a few months dumping you is a valid reason for catatonia and almost-suicide.(**)** And yet we still get readers who divide themselves into the incredibly annoying ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"". (***)*** Because clearly nothing else ever matters besides sappy love - in a book about children murdering each other. *eyeroll* 
  
 Now, here is what bugged me about the romance that DID make it into the book. There is actually a LOST OPPORTUNITY here to have a YA book where people CAN be just friends, where devotion and loyalty stem from friendship and respect and not from attraction.  Katniss and Peeta could have had plenty of other reasons to care for each other that don't include puppy love - they are from the same district, same school, he gave her that bread, she trades with his dad, etc. But alas, that did not happen. I understand that Collins had to cater to the way that YA publishers and Hollywood tend to view us, the female audience. At least Katniss escapes the perils of insta-love. But poor Peeta - all of his actions are colored by him being ""Lover Boy"", and I think it detracts from his personality and reduces him from a kind compassionate person to a fool in love who'd do anything for Katniss only because of his physical attraction to her. Yeah......Rue...Oh, Rue...Now, back to the GOOD. Rue, my favorite character. Little, fragile, almost-too-perfect Rue who was clearly doomed from the start. Who despite her appearance was neither weak nor helpless. Whose (view spoiler)[death scene (hide spoiler)] brought the human side to Katniss (who, until that point, was almost bordering on robotic). There was real grief and anger and sadness in that scene, and from that point on I began to care. Suzanne Collins strictly follows the ""show, don't tell"" rule. (Actually, she does it to such an extent that the book reads almost like a screenplay.) The plot moves along at a fast pace, only slowing down a bit in the drawn out Capitol makeover and cave makeout sessions. Collins does not shy away from gruesome scenes, making many parts of the book hit home.----------I enjoyed it despite the imperfections. Katniss easily beats the majority of the popular YA heroines. And because of all her coolness, this gets 3.75 stars. 
  ""Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat."" 
-----------------------------------------
  EDITED TO ADD:
 So I saw the movie today. All I have to say - Suzanne Collins may have given life to Katniss, but Jennifer Lawrence definitely gave her heart. Lawrence's Katniss has such emotional depth, and she brings such truthfulness to her character. Excellent adaptation with a great balance of tugging on the heartstrings and darkness.I CRIED TWICE (yes, apparently I am less of a cynic than I thought). First time - when Katniss volunteers for Prim and people salute her. I JUST CHOKED UP. It felt so real. I have a brother who is much younger than me, and all I could think at that moment was how I would do the exact same thing for him WITHOUT ANY HESITATION. It wouldn't even be a choice. Just like it wasn't for Katniss. *Sob* The second time I teared up - Rue. Oh Rue... And the salute from District 11 - so powerful and so touching. I...I...I just can't... PLEASE EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO AND GRAB A BOX OF TISSUES. OR TWO. OR TEN. *SOB*","Dec 07, 2010"
"9780439023481","2296903","Jana","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2296903-jana","A lot of things are troubling me about The Hunger Games. A lot of things which I more and more perceive and which are not solely connected with this book but with the metaphor behind the words. People attach themselves to fictional freedom without seeing what really something is and which unfortunately is here to stay because you can't wake a person who is pretending to be asleep. You can’t make a shift on a deeper level, if the only thing that attracts you to this book is – a vision of fight, retaliation and the outcome of freedom. Freedom of flesh. In comparison to the freedom of and from your mind which is nowhere to be found. And this is why I detest this book, although detest is such a strong from the ego word. Because the whole purpose of this story is to show how people shouldn’t sacrifice their children for the better of their communities and with the positive outcomes realise that we are so much stronger and yada yada. THE WHOLE PURPOSE of this book should be that there shouldn’t even be in the first place a need to sacrifice members of our society for some other people to be amused. And where after the battle of ''united'' people we heal and repair the damages for the better tomorrow. The society cancer of western civilisation thinking. Heal the damage, never heal the cause of it. But then we wouldn’t be talking here about the same book. We would be discussing how humanity can help each other with being better, with taking responsibility and with being open to each other. And yet imagine this paradox we live in: better, as if the majority of population can even understand that we are in constant blood thirst to achieve peace. With war comes peace. While along the way we are trying to be better and safer. Yet most people deliberately choose to live on the utmost lowest level of their existence. In fear, frightened of itself.And people read books which are so extreme in their bullshit. And people connect with Katniss because she is the heroine. She has managed to outsmart the system. Instead of thinking that she was not even supposed be there in the first place. Because we live in society that does this to their children. ''No, we don’t!''''We do...''''But children can learn how to fight.''''You teach them to fight for individual puppeteers. And instead of working on yourself, how to achieve your inner peace, you associate yourself again with the group because it feels better to be in the tortured crowd, instead of being alone and awakened.''''What are you talking about? It is just emo gibberish. Leave Katniss alone. And in the end, it is just a book. Why don’t you want people to read and educate themselves, does everything have to be deep and meaningful, can’t you just relax?''Yes, everything has to be deep and meaningful since we are drowning in shit of meaningless and shallow. The system as it is, the plot of this book is just another evidence to show us how we are controlled. That we are left barren from our true selves which we only find in empathy, love towards each other and genuinely understanding that we are one and everything is one. But on this provincial&marginal&primitive&emotional level, so many took this book for granted. And the only reason I am writing this review here, the only reason I am giving it so much attention is to tell what is on my mind since it is so widely popular and since I have read it. And one of the main reasons why I can’t really keep things light and popsy is because so many things are already deep down in gutter light and popsy and mainstream. As if having money is any critieria for life, as if not having your own free will and education and information means nothing. And the other side of the rich coin is poverty with people who believe in symbols, who are sidetracked with religions, censured TV, economy and utter lack of information circulation. And a lot of people here are trying to disregard this review and want to reassure me that I am so terribly wrong. BUT, you have yet not seen what I am talking about and it is perfectly OK. So I followed as well screaming Goodreads recommendations and I bought a book that is stupid, violent and written so plainly but of course written for vast masses so they can be touched by fake social awareness. Because it is fake, but most of all it’s tragic. And this is not a critique toward Collins, in my nature of a thinker and seeing her a person who shared her thoughts and which millions of people loved and connected with, I am still a firm believer that the general public just didn’t understand what she was talking about. And this is my silver lining. Because it has been like this throughout centuries and with the biggest thinkers of our civilisation. What they meant and wanted to show, is definitely not what most of the public projected. Because the mainstream public is a group of sheep, not seeing anything properly, but following and like a Tarzan, screaming, don’t you dare stealing my Jane from me. As a metaphor, don’t you dare telling me these uplifting emotions are not true, when all in me about this book tells me that is correct and how people should live their lives. And if the mainstream likes it, uh, then definitely that is not what it’s true. It is just a constant reminder how so many things are left unrecognised while these superficial stories which evoke cheap emotions are always so hugely praised. It could have been just a little story but never underestimate the obese octopus that is called In God And Country We Trust - code red mentality. Mentality of humans which are too ignorant, beautifully naive and untouched basically with what is means to be socially aware. And although this is a teen book, it is more deeply hurting and sickening because if you want to influence somebody, of course you will influence the children – and yet there is nothing that children can learn from it. They can learn some things, we all need little courageous Katniss, but on a deeper subtler level is it just an intravenous injection of more Nothing and more Numbing and more Disconnected. At least they read is one of the arguments. And argument as fruitfull as at least they eat GMO food. One food for the blind intellect, other for the digestion which both results in basic survival without any interference of you in all of it. Because it takes courage and guts and a pinch of anarchy to stop, turn around and start questioning what is handed. For me, the thought about giving this to a child is sickening especially because we live in this world where all the life criterias are upside down. Because a child will not learn how things are vile and disturbing because Katniss told them through her delusional and hyperventilating focus, but a child will learn about life’s cruelty, and it will be touched by it sooner or later, by questioning everything that is served in front of it. Because if it is served somebody is earning money and you are just getting fatter and sicker. And the children will learn how to question if you teach them how to find not if you broadcast them the answers. Not if you teach them through aggressive examples and if you keep the nation in cold sweat especially if you are lucky enough to live in the countries where oppression is not the issue but consumerism, body image and mediocrity have you on the leash. I am astonished with a fact that around 75.000 Goodreads members read this book and that around 50.000 of them rated it 5 stars. What is it that fascinates them so much. It’s disturbing because people obviously associate and find themselves in this book. And it's about a girl Katniss Everdeen, living in the far away future, who was chosen to participate in a cruel Big Brother game, in which 24 contestants (children age 12-18) kill each other, because live TV has become demanding, and the public loves reality blood and violence. That's it. A little bit of undeveloped and unbelievable romance between her and two boys, a little bit of her abandoned family problems, a little bit of The 5th element movie political structure, mutants and pop stylists. It’s so screwed up. In the beginning, first 50 pages were well written. There was suspense, Katniss was sweet and witty, but overall this book is a shitty meltdown. Adding the ridiculous cliffhanger ending. Some people here are using words like dystopian literature, and then write essays about how this book is the core of it. The core is pointlessly graphic and sadistic, without any concrete message except of the negative: this book is just proving that the world today is fucked up if this book is so successful. I don’t see the point of reading about the fictional kids who are doing this to each other. In a metaphorical way it is promoting political establishments of certain countries and that is getting tiring. Not all people are eager to swallow the shit of general brainwashing. Katniss being the heroine (ironical quote marks). Being loyal and darling and a role model. Just wake up. Life is happening and some pretty dark things are happening while you are thinking that Katniss is the representative of the club called liberation. For me, in a bookish way it stands for one bad one night stand, kiss and forget. But as always, readers tend to bring fiction to their real life and just as many think that kittens and superheroes are comfort zones, a lot of readers perceive this plot as their own little shrine. But that is me not being in tune with the mainstream population which is too distracted with billboards. Because it is easier, because why protest, why not simply take what you are given - eat your GMO Monsanto's company hamburgers, eat your cancer giving Nestle products and think that The Hunger Games are the best franchise ever, like ever. If you don't have any arguments about real life activism and if you think that there is deepness in this plot which I have yet not seen so you need to enlightened me, just include North Korea or Hitler or ISIS(L) or those poor people who are closed in Zara hangers who work nonstop ''somewhere'' in the world because obviously you are aware of the crisis although you don’t think you could show on the map but you have heard somewhere on Murdoch media. This shit sells. It's genuinely bad but excellently targeted. You know, it evokes pride and loyalty and massacring children, freedom and scandal and Hollywood. It goes very well with all the Kardashian filth. As long as it sells, sells, sells. And marketing agencies know that people are united when they are jealous, when they want and they with those hamburgers want freedom. Nobody is going to kill their Katniss in a goddam book! Really? Take a look around you. And then the punch line for this book comes from the so called activism from the shopping mall. People who devour literature of this kind and think that everything is all right while in the same time, fuck, you are getting oozingly fat. Bottom line.This book is very shallow and MTV culture oriented, like a classical example of easy consummated pop-literature; I'm very surprised that it didn't come with some trash magazine subscription. If it doesn't have savage brutality, prize money and prefix ''media coverage'' then it won't be appealing and educational because surely this is how children of 21st century survive this techno media world; through examples of true moral issues and realistic outcomes. Have another gulp of Coca-Cola along the way while you listen to dubstep shit. It saddens me when a violent hillbillish book is so popular. What is there to truly identify yourself with. Except if your chicken soup for soul are basic emotions which come with buy 1 get 1 free.","May 05, 2010"
"9780439023481","1199525","Cecily","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily","If I were a teenager or recommending this to a teen, I might give it 3*; as an adult, I give it 2*.PLOTIt's a potentially exciting but gruesome story, but most of the characters were rather flat, much of the plot was predictable (it's not hugely original; in particular, it is VERY similar to the Japanese ""Battle Royale""), and there were too many flaws in the plot. I fail to understand its very high ratings.Post-apocalyptic America (Panem) is divided into a wealthy and technologically advanced Capitol and twelve subsidiary districts of oppressed people who exist in dire poverty, with inadequate food, housing, and health care and hardly any technology. To reinforce the power of the Capitol by instilling fear in the population, once a year, two children from each region are selected by lots to fight to the death in a reality show. If that were not bad enough, the whole thing is utterly corrupt in multiple ways, plus the public bet on the outcome, and sponsors can sway the results. Did I mention these are children? (Some are as young as 12, though the narrator is 16.) A compulsory full-body wax on a teen seems rather pervy and who would want to bet on, let alone sponsor a child-killing tournament, even if it's by helping one of the contestants? As the book keeps reminding readers, one person's survival is only possible by the death of all the others.CRUELTY TO CHILDRENI realise that horrendous things are done to children around the world every day (extreme poverty, child soldiers, sexual assault, genital mutilation etc), but in none of those cases is the sole intention that all but one child dies, and nor is it organised by the government for a sick combination of sport, entertainment, punishment and profit. Humans often lack compassion, but I was never convinced by Collins' world - especially the fact this outrage has continued for three generations (it's the 74th games), apparently without the Capitol even needing to invoke gods or supernatural powers to justify their cruelty! Could a barbaric annual tournament really be such a powerful incentive not to rise up in all that time? (I don't think so.)BIG ISSUESNevertheless, it tackles some big themes that are particularly pertinent to teens: the nature of friendship; divided loyalties; the difference between love and friendship; who to trust; whether the ends justify the means; the need to repay favours; the danger of power, wealth and celebrity; the corrupting influence of reality TV; the need for independence, and whether you can trust a parent who abandons you. It all feels rather laboured to me, but it might not if I were a teen, which only reinforces my puzzlement at the number of adults who have enjoyed it. I must be missing something.NARRATIVE STRUCTURE Nearly half the book is backstory and preparation for the games; the remainder is a tale of hunter and hunted. I predicted the main plot twist less than a quarter of the way in (and the fact that Katniss is telling the story limits the possible outcomes), but the suspense was broken when it was made explicit way before the end. There are some other twists between then and the final page, but by then I was rather annoyed with the whole thing.IMPLAUSIBILITY AND INCONSISTENCIESIf I'd enjoyed the book more, I would have found it easier to suspend my disbelief, but as it was, I was constantly irked by questions and inconsistencies. * The contestants (and their parents and grandparents) have been forced to watch the games every year of their lives. I suppose they had become inured to it, but on the other hand, that meant they knew the horror of it. I just didn't believe there was as little fear in them as there appeared to be - given that they are children. * Participants don't want other participants to know where they are, yet sponsor gifts occasionally drop out of the sky, via silver parachute; not a risk, apparently. * It's all filmed by numerous invisible floating cameras (I can buy that), but that somehow includes filming inside a cave that is virtually sealed (I can't). * How (and why) would any of these participants be able to measure time to within half hour intervals?* How big is Panem? It can only be a tiny part of the USA because each district specialises in only one thing (coal mining, agriculture etc) and has just one town square that can accommodate everyone (8,000 people in District 12) and yet it's a day's train journey from District 12 to the Capitol. It doesn't seem like a very plausible settlement pattern in a post-disaster world, even given the totalitarian regime (concentrating people in a few centres makes it easier to observe and perhaps control them, but it also creates more opportunities for opposition movements to develop).COMPARED WITH LORD OF THE FLIESThere are some similarities with ""Lord of the Flies"" (my review here: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...), but although ""The Hunger Games"" is likely to have more appeal to modern teens, I think there are (at least) two crucial differences:* In LotF one person's survival is not necessarily at the cost of everyone else's. (It is even possible that they could all survive.)* LotF has much more depth and symbolism: it tackles original sin; the mystical ""Beast""; leadership, tribal allegiance and group dynamics (including bullying and attitudes to difference and minor disability) and the importance of ritual and belief.The second point is what makes LotF a better book, in my opinion. Of course, there are other, more obvious, parallels with extreme ""reality"" shows such as ""Survivor"" and ""I'm a Celebrity, get me out of here"", but the fundamental differences are not just that contestants in those shows do not fear for their lives, but that they are adults who have chosen to enter. I TRIED TO ENJOY IT!Any fans who read this will now hate me. I wanted to enjoy this book, and I read it all the way through, making notes as usual, but to no avail. Sorry.","Jun 17, 2011"
"9780439023481","1302775","Meredith Holley (Sparrow)","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1302775-meredith-holley-sparrow","For a long time now, I’ve wanted to rewrite my review of The Hunger Games so that I could tell you why I don’t just love this series, but why I also think it’s important. It is beautiful for the unflinching way it shows you, as a reader, your own willingness to disregard people who are different from you - how you are the Capitol audience. But, it is important as a story about girls. I had not initially thought about articulating that point because it seemed so obvious to me, and I am bad at recognizing my own assumptions. Lately, though, I have seen so many people, both men and women, acting as though this remarkable book is a piece of fluff that I realized maybe what I love most about The Hunger Games is not as obvious as it seems. To me, this series is important because it is a landmark departure from the traditional story about girls.Too often, stories objectify women. But the word “objectify,” I’ve realized, has almost no meaning for someone who has either not experienced objectification or who hasn’t really recognized it in her own life, so I’m going to be more descriptive here. When I say stories objectify girls, I mean they talk about girls as though they are fleshlights that sometimes have handy dandy extra gadgets such as an all-purpose cleaning mechanism and food dispensing function. Sidebar: if you are inclined to now google the word ""fleshlight,"" I encourage you to consult the urban dictionary definition here before doing that, as the google results will probably be NSFW and also NSF those of you whose parents might check your browsing history. Do parents know how to do that? Sorry for the sidebar, I am just intending to make an explicit point, and now I am feeling uncomfortable about what that explicit point might mean to the target audience of this book. Girls, you are probably badass like Katniss, and you are definitely not a fleshlight. Back to my rant about typical objectification in storytelling: often the girls fleshlights have fancy outer designs  because it makes the fleshlights happy to be fancy. Sometimes they have skeeeeeery castration functions, and other times they work as helpful databases for music or video games or whatever UR into. A lot of times, I will hear people refer to this type of objectification as treating women like they are just a vagina, or a pair of boobs, but I think there is something to the stories that is less human and more sexbot machine than that complaint covers.So, in all of those links, I have tried to include books written by men and by women because I think that women think of ourselves this way almost as often as men think of us this way. The link from The Ugly Truth, for example, shows both a man and a woman treating women like fleshlights. I have also included both books I love and books I hate because, ultimately, I do think girls adopt this story about themselves, and I also think we can pretty easily identify with a male protagonist and disregard female characters who look nothing like humans. For example, The Sun Also Rises is one of my favorite books in the whole world, even though it does not contain any women who resonate with my experience of humans. And I don't think it's necessarily bad that I can enjoy stories where women are only fleshlights, as long as I can still be whoever I want to be without a positive role model. I think it's good to enjoy stories and take what we can get from them, and so I don't regret that I love The Sun Also Rises.In seeing some male reactions to The Hunger Games, I am reminded that most men do not identify with female protagonists the way women have been trained to identify with male protagonists. This seems like a huge disadvantage for men to be in, to me, and if you are a man reading this review, I would ask you to check out your bookshelves. How many female authors are on your shelves? How many of the books those authors wrote have no central male character? If you have a minute after that, check the shelves of a woman you are friends with and see how many of her books were written by men or have no central female character. Odds are the results will be pretty different.The Hunger Games is such a groundbreaking and deliberate example of a woman’s perspective on war and family and even men that it floors me. I think it partly floors me because, other than Buffy, I can’t think of another example of a female character who really fights for herself in such an obvious and hopeful way. Katniss is strong and broken, and powerful in her brokenness. Collins’s image of a woman’s perspective is not, admittedly, as effortless as Moira Young’s in Blood Red Road, but its deliberateness has its own value. It is not an accident that the story shows Katniss’s emotional growth and that Peeta, as a more emotionally whole person, facilitates her emotional growth. It is not an accident that the story does not discuss the effect Katniss has on the erectness of Peeta’s and Gale’s penises. The first is not an accident because in reality, men do not have to be the emotional cowards that the stories I’ve linked to above make them out to be. Masculinity does not have to mean emotional cowardice. The second is not an accident because the story is not from Peeta and Gale’s perspectives. Despite widespread rumors to the contrary, it is my experience that women pretty seldom think about their effect on men’s penises. Hopefully, we never think of our primary purpose in life, in the way so many stories think of it, as making penises erect. Hopefully, we never think of ourselves as gadgets that are super fun for other people.There are so many reasons I love The Hunger Games series, and all of this is one I wouldn’t have initially even thought to say. I saw this Eleanor Roosevelt quote earlier this month, and it said, “It is better to light one small candle than to curse the darkness.” I think The Hunger Games is a candle in the overall dark narrative of girls’ perspective on life. Yes, it is also a poignant critique of reality TV and Western callousness about the catastrophes caused by industrialization in the developing world, but that, too, resonates with me in many ways because of its remarkably feminine voice. It absolutely makes sense to me that this book is not for everyone because of its violence, but I still think that it is objectively important because it shows a perspective that seems authentically feminine to me – that talks like a girl, not like a sexy, fancy gadget. I’m not saying that in my opinion girls don’t or shouldn’t ever think about being sexy or erect penises, I’m just saying that it is my experience that we think and care about many, many more things than penises, clean houses, and food, and very, very few stories are willing to tell you about that. The Hunger Games is one that does, and it does so in way that is beautiful and important.","Sep 20, 2008"
"9780439023481","395578","elissa","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395578-elissa","I LOVE THIS BOOK! I've said to a few people that if I wasn't married, I'd have to marry this book. :) I read the 400 page ARC in a less-than-24-hour time period (so quickly that it was never even on my ""currently reading"" shelf), which I've only done before with HP books, and I've just officially put the first book on my 2008 favorites shelf. I feel pretty safe in saying that if this isn't still my favorite book of the year when next January rolls around, that I'll eat a hat. As soon as I finished reading it, I turned around and read it a 2nd time, which I've never done before in my life. I loved all of Collins' GREGOR books, and think she's a wonderful writer, but she's ratcheted it up to another level with this one. Even though it's the first in a trilogy, this one definitely stands alone, and I'm not sure how she can keep it up for another 2 books, but I suppose it's possible (think: THE GIVER, although I loved GATHERING BLUE, and liked THE MESSENGER--HUNGER GAMES is much more brutal than THE GIVER, though). It's got some very meaty issues to chew on, not the least of which is reality TV taken to extremes. There's a chaste and unresolved romance (think: TWILIGHT, but I don't think I will make it past the first in that series--HUNGER GAMES has much more action, more of a plot, lots of well-developed secondary characters, as well as extremely likeable main characters. I will miss Katniss until I can read about her again.). What more could you possibly ask for out of a book? It doesn't actually come out until October 2008, but if you can get your hands on an ARC, definitely do! I think that the violence in this will be easier for kids to take, since they probably won't see it quite as clearly as an adult will. None of it is particularly graphic, but it is definitely brutal. This is on the edge of too dark for me, which is my favorite kind of book. There aren't many writers who can push it right to the edge for me without going over (Zusak comes to mind immediately), but Collins is definitely one of them. Another book that I loved, and think of to compare this to is HOUSE OF THE SCORPION, but that fell apart slightly at the end for me. HUNGER GAMES didn't lack anything at all for me. OK, I'll stop gushing. I may have to re-write this review when I get some perspective. (2012: Obviously, I never did rewrite it, and this is my most-""liked"" review :) My 10 1/2 yr old son asked to read this with me, so I read it for the 3rd time with him in Oct 2008. Still my definite favorite book of the year, but all the typos in the finished book were pretty disappointing. Still, it's my choice for just about any award out there, come January, including the JHUNT. Update May 2009: I am dying because the CATCHING FIRE ARC has just been released, and people are saying it's at least as good at HG. I've had 2 teenaged boys at my library read this on my recommendation, and both of them came back asking me for more books like it (really there isn't anything). One of them has pre-ordered CATCHING FIRE on Amazon (and I worked in a fairly disadvantaged neighborhood in DC at the time, so that was not a usual occurrence). May-June 2011: I'm reading this for the 4th time, with my younger son, who's finishing up 5th grade. Still as good as ever!! Can't wait for the movie!!Update 2012: Between them, HG and CATCHING FIRE were the pinnacle of my 20-yr career as a YA librarian! I've seen the movie twice so far, and definitely liked it better the 2nd time, when it didn't have to try to be my favorite book. :)","Apr 05, 2008"

Um...well *shuffles feet, since I seem to be a rare non-five star-er* not original at all really.... Man, I wish someone on my friends list here has also read Battle Royale and this book! The Hunger Games WAS pretty fantastic, hence the four stars (though I would have given 3 1/2 if the choice was available.) I ate it up, shouting into other rooms and offices that I was going to be shoving the book into their hands as soon as I was done, but as it went on desha vu was a little too common for me. I know there are major story types out there, ones that are repeated over and over again. Shakespeare retold 200 different ways. The bible reinterpreted to 2,000,000 varieties of tales....but when it comes to YA dystopia, which is by far my favorite genre of any book, originality is one of my main ways I judge a book. FEED felt utterly original. The world of UGLIES felt new. LITTLE BROTHER was just plain amazing. If it's going to be about ""the future"" we don't know about, make it original. In my mind dystopia novels survive on ""idea"" more than ""excecution"" and while the execution of this was beautiful, the idea was hardly new. While I have a really good feeling Collins never read, or maybe even heard of, Battle Royale, The Hunger Games was 90% the plot of Battle Royal, minus the guns, the extra blood, the ability to get to know all the other players. In Battle Royal (short explanation of BR plot: 40 students put on island forced to kill each other and winner is set for life and put on TV etc...), the main focus is a love story between two students trapped in the game, two students bonding together with no real urge to kill others...one of whom had a crush on the other forever and it is only revealed during the game. There are so many other similarities, from the ways the gamemakers manipulate, to the ways the media encourages, to one character having a fever and the other taking care of them with soup. There are even ""career"" battle royal players. In BR you see the emotions before and after someone is killed, their last thoughts, the feeling of the person who killed. It's actually really beautiful the way it is done, and so believable that put in an arena teens WOULD turn into savages. In The Hunger Games, yes the main characters were fantastic, and many of the lesser as well, but Foxface is only Foxface, and the Careers are never more than random 1-dimensional bad guys. The Hunger Games was very Battle Royale, very The Long Walk (Richard Bachman book), and very much current reality shows. I am not saying it wasn't a GREAT read, I'm just saying it shouldn't shake the publishing earth the way I am pretty sure it is going to. I anticipate this is the next Twilight series people are going to gush over. In a few years we'll all be hosting Hunger Games final book parties. I'll be amongst the attendees I'm sure. Also in terms of female main characters, Katiniss may surpass Bella in me wanting to shake sense into a character. Talk about a smart girl being utterly clueless! Yes, it was great, but eh, maybe I'm just bitter because I think BR is the better book of the two and while Hunger Games will get tons of praise and likely a rather deserved award or two, BR will continue to be banned in many libraries. Amazing what subtracting guns can do to a story. Suddenly it doesn't feel as violent, but rather is more reminiscent of stories we heard growing up. The number of swords and arrow deaths in traditional fairytales is nothing to freak out about, but if bullets are flying, it will give ""too many ideas"" to teens and therefore must be dubbed an adult book. I'm pretty sure if I hadn't read BR just a few months back this exeedingly long review would have been just as long only instead of a rant it would have just been one long squeeeeeal of delight over how much I loved the book.

So, I really really liked this book!! Of course, I loved Peeta!How can I not? He is perfect! But Katniss? Why?? She is so strong and bad-ass but she always misunderstands Peeta! It's so obvious that he loves her but she is in denial! She is so stupid!! And when she realizes his feelings, she just hurt him! Congrats!4 stars because of Katniss' stupidity!Let's start from the beginning!What is Hunger Games?Every year, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 were selected from each of the twelve districts as tributes, who train for a week and then are sent into an arena to fight to the death.Only one tribute can win the games. This competition is showed to television to be seen by all citizens.So, Katniss' little sister, Prim, is selected for the games, but Katniss took her place to save her. 
  
    ""I volunteer! I volunteer as tribute!""
  
The boy who was chosen to participate was Peeta Mellark, a boy who Katniss knew because she saved her from starvation and give her some bread as a result his mother beat him!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1) I loved Peeta! He protected her but I will admit she protected him as well! She risked her life to get the medicine needed to heal his leg. But how can she not see that he is madly in love with her? I loved it when he told her about her singing for the music class, that's when Peeta realized he was in love with her when he saw that the birds were listening like they did for her father.
  
    “No, it happened. And right when your song ended, I knew - just like your mother - I was a goner,"" Peeta says.” 
  
2)I think she has feelings for him deep down! Very deep. 
  
    “I don't want to lose the boy with the bread.” 
  
 Sometimes when she kissed Peeta she felt guilty because of Gale! Why????He is her best friend! At the beginning, she said that she never saw him that way and now what? She is confusing me.Please, not love triangle again!!I liked Gale but no! 3)Curiously, I liked Haymitch! He won the Hunger Games of his time. He is also Katniss' and Peeta's mentor. It seems at first that he doesn't like Katniss very much but at the Hunger Games he helped her more than he helped Peeta. 
  
    “Here's some advice. Stay alive.” 
  
4)I also liked Cinna, their stylist. He always supported her in his way.5)Rue! She was the 12-year-old female tribute from District 11. I really liked that Katniss allied with Rue. They were amazing together. But Rue died. I understand only one can win( our case two) but I felt so sad when she died. Not only her though. A lot innocent kids die because of the Capitol. It's not fair.6)In the half of the games, it was announced that two tributes from the same district can win. So katniss and Peeta can be allies. But when all the other tributes died it was announced that the rule they said early has been canceled. I was so angry! They did it on purpose. Assholes!!!7)When they announced it, Katniss aimed her bow at Peeta when she sees he has picked up a weapon, but he throw it into the lake. She is so stupid. He didn't want to fight her and she thought that he could kill her. 8)I was scared when Peeta and Katniss threaten to commit double suicide so there will be no winner! But it was a trick. Thankfully, that trick worked and both PEETA AND KATNISS WERE WINNERS!9)And the ending! Peeta discovers that Katniss was mostly acting during the games about the feelings. He was so heartbroken! My baby!

As an author we were accustomed to your fun adventures involving a boy, his sister, and a world beneath our world. I think it's fair to say that we weren’t really expecting something like The Hunger Games. At least I wasn’t. But reading it gave me a horribly familiar feeling. There is a certain strain of book that can hypnotize you into believing that you are in another time and place roughly 2.3 seconds after you put that book down.  Life As We Knew It by Susan Beth Pfeffer could convince me that there were simply not enough canned goods in my home. And The Hunger Games? Well as I walked down the street I was under the disctinc impression that there were hidden cameras everywhere, charting my progress home. Collins has written a book that is exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns. It ascends to the highest forms of the science fiction genre and will create all new fans for the writer. One of the best books of the 2008 year.Life in District 12 isn’t easy for Katniss and her family. Ever since her father died the girl has spent her time saving her mother and little sister Prim from starvation by hunting on forbidden land. But worst of all is reaping day. Once a year the government chooses two children from each of the twelve districts to compete against one another in a live and televised reality show. Twenty-four kids and teens enter, and only one survives. When Prim's name is called, Katniss exchanges herself without hesitation to compete alongside the baker’s boy Peeta. To survive in this game you need to win the heart of your audience, and so District 12’s trainers come up with a plan. Why not make it as if Peeta and Katniss were in love with one another? But in a game where only one person can live, Katniss will have to use all her brains, wits, and instincts to determine who to trust and how to outwit the game's creators.I described the plot of this book to my husband, particularly the part where Katniss and Peeta fake being in love to gain the audience’s approval and the very first thing he said was, “Oh! That’s the plot of They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?"" Then I mentioned that it took place in the future and that government leaders set up teenagers to fight one another to the death and he said, ""Battle Royale”. So sure, there are parts of this plot that have been done before. You could say it's The Game meets Spartacus with some Survivor thrown in for spice. But that’s not what makes a book good or bad, is it? Some of the greatest works of literature out there, regardless of the readerships' age, comes about when an author takes overdone or familiar themes and then makes them entirely new through the brilliance of their own writing. Harry Potter wouldn’t have been any great shakes if it weren’t for Rowling’s storytelling. Similarly, Collins takes ideas that have certainly seen the light of day before and concocts an amazingly addictive text. About the time you get to the fifth chapter that ends with a sentence that forces you to read on, you’re scratching your head wondering how the heck she DOES that.Your story often rests on the shoulders of the protagonist. Is this a believable character? Do you root for him or her? Because basically it is a very hard thing to create a “good” person on the page that your reader is going to fall in love with. Because we readers know that we are flawed, we are often inclined to side with the similarly flawed people we meet between a book’s covers. Katniss, on the other hand, is so good in so many ways. She sacrifices herself for her sister. She tries to save people in the game. But there’s almost a jock mentality to her too. Katniss can figure out the puzzles and problems in the game, but when it comes to emotional complexity she’s sometimes up a tree. Most remarkable to me was the fact that Katniss could walk around, oblivious to romance, and not bug me. Seriously, nothing gets under my skin faster than heroines who can’t see that their fellow fellas are jonesing for them. You just want to bonk the ladies upside the head with a brick or something. The different here is maybe the fact that since Katniss knows that Peeta has to play a part, she uses that excuse (however unconsciously) to justify his seeming affection for her. Thems smart writing.Oh! And did I mention the dialogue at all? The humor? Yep, there’s humor. We’re talking about a story where adolescents hunger for blood, and Katniss is getting in lines about her trainers like, “And then, because it’s Effie and she’s apparently required by law to say something awful...” Good stuff. The words pop off the page. And then there’s the fact that we’re dealing with a dystopian novel where the author has somehow managed to create a believable future. No faux slang here, or casual references to extinct dolphins. There are some animals that were scientifically altered, but you can’t have a future without a couple cool details like that, right?In general, this book throws a big fat wrench into the boy book/girl book view of child/teen literature. People love to characterize books by gender. It stars a boy? Boy book. A girl? Girl book. Now take a long lengthy look at the first book in the Hunger Games Trilogy. It stars a girl... and a boy too. There’s a lot of hunting, fighting, and survival... and a lot of romance, kisses, and cool outfits. There’s strategy, the world’s most fabulous fashion designer, weapons and a girl who knows how to fight. This is not a book that quietly slots into our preconceived stereotypes. And you know what happens to books that span genders? They sell very well indeed. That is, if you can get both boys and girls to read them.The age range? Well, for most of this story I would have said ten and up. I mean, yeah the basic premise is that a lot of teenagers go around killing one another, and sure there’s some romance to deal with, but none of it really seems inappropriate... until a final death scene appears in the book. I won’t give any details, but suffice it to say it is gruesome. There are definite horror elements to it as well, so with that in mind I am upping my recommendation to 12 and up. I’m sure that there are 10-year-olds out there who’ve seen much worse stuff on cable, just as there are 12-year-olds who’ll freak out ten pages in. Still, I’m more comfortable recommending it for the older kids rather than the younger. You'll see why.It occurs to me that there has never been a quintessential futuristic gladiator book for kids. That is undoubtedly the roughest term you can give this book. Now I’m not a person who cries easily when she reads something, particularly something for kids. Yet as I was taking a train to Long Island I found myself tearing up over significant parts of this story. It’s good. And it’s so ridiculous that a work of science fiction like this could even be so good. You think of futuristic arena tales and your mind instantly sinks to the lowest common denominator. What Collins has done here is set up a series that will sink its teeth into readers. The future of this book will go one of two ways. Either it will remain an unappreciated cult classic for years to come or it will be fully appreciated right from the start and lauded. My money lies with the latter. A contender in its own right.Ages 12 and up.","Jun 02, 2008"

  It seems weird that I never reviewed 
  The Hunger Games
. I don't know why I didn't when it was a series that completely took over my life for a short while. But recently I've been thinking about posting something in this review space and after just watching the second film (which I think was amazing and better than the first), now seems like as good a time as any to talk about why I love Katniss and nearly everything about this series.I gave this book four stars back in 2011 and I'm going to leave that rating as it is because it's an indicator of my thoughts at the time (though they slightly differ now) - thoughts which were influenced by having just finished the fantastic, horrifying, brutal and unforgettable Battle Royale manga series. I don't think it was the best time for myself and Katniss to find one another when I had so much beautiful insanity to compare the book to, but it still managed to have such an effect on me that I instantly told every friend and family member to read it. Coming back to this now after having spent the last couple of years being bombarded with dystopian YA, I appreciate what Collins has achieved a whole lot more. I appreciate the strength of Katniss as a heroine who commands our attention and holds our love whilst still being what some would consider unlikable; I appreciate the balance of beauty and horror that Collins delivers on every page, treating us constantly to both the darkest despair and rays of hope; and I also - amazingly - appreciate the love triangle. Love triangles seem to have chased me and hunted me down with every YA read I picked up over the last two or three years - my dislike for romance instantly becoming doubled by the introduction of yet another boy with beautiful eyes. But Katniss, Peeta and Gale worked for me. They convinced me, held my interest and made me cry. The love triangle worked because it's outcome wasn't obvious, because we all wondered and hoped and worried. Because, either way, I was always going to be half happy and half sad.Katniss still remains for me everything that a female protagonist should be. Or a female hero, at least. She fights for the ones she loves, she's brave and doesn't need to be saved. But neither is she a one-dimensional smiling poster-version of a heroine. She falls, she fails, people get hurt because of her and she has to live with that. We love her and yet she's antisocial, awkward and moody. She loves other people with all her heart but she's not much of a team player. In short: she's a complex portrait of a young woman that doesn't fall into any neatly defined boxes or categories. Now, perhaps, authors have since tried to recreate her. But she's still one of the first and best.I know another review of this book isn't needed. I know you've all probably read it anyway. Or never will. But this isn't really for anyone else; it's a reminder to myself of why this book deserves its hype and why I need to remember to come back to it again and again between the new (and hopefully amazing) YA books I'll be reading in the future.","Dec 24, 2010"
"9780439023481","4224396","Lyndsey","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4224396-lyndsey","Oh no. You've awakened the beast. It's Jackniss!!Yeah. So maybe Matthew Fox from Lost isn't exactly the person you had in mind when you thought about who they might cast as Katniss in The Hunger Games, but I was inspired to create that after I saw this site called Jackimals. You might want to wait to visit it, though, because it can suck you in like an unexplained time warp flash.I was also inspired to create the Jackniss after I read a discussion that deeply disturbed me.Somewhere, possibly on Goodreads, I read that someone thought the Lost writers should get involved in writing the Hunger Games script. What!?!? Forget the genius Suzanne Collins, let's give it to the guys who left the greatest mystery in all of TV history completely unexplained. Don't get me wrong. I love Lost and appreciate it greatly, but they really explained nothing in terms of the plot. But don't even get me started on that - Circuits overloading. Bzzzt. *sparks*Both Lost and Hunger Games are great character stories, but Hunger Games needs plot. It cannot do without. That's obviously not going to happen since Suzanne has already written the script, but just play along for a second.Here's how I think it would go...Katniss is being chased by one of the mutts who suddenly turns into the smoke monster, which gobbles her up in flashes of lightning and the sound of mechanical teeth grinding while playing a flashback of her life in the District. It quickly chokes her back up realizing she's a candidate to replace Jacob but she's in such shock from the experience that she lays down and dies, with a stunning close-up of her eye closing. Roll credits.Now, if you haven't read The Hunger Games yet, I won't even try to justify why you should. You just should. This is just one of those books that someone says ""This book is AMAZING."" Then, you take their word for it and read it.And seriously, WHY haven't you read it yet?This is the kind of book that is so awesome in a completely thrilling and demented and emotional and shocking way that it makes you want to bang your head against the wall while throwing fairy dust in joy. Two things that I have done in the past, but never before at the same time. That's how powerful this book is.After that, it makes you want to cry. Cry like a little baby. Like a little baby in it's crib. Then scream. Scream like a frikkin banshee with a frikkin laser beam on it's forehead.Before I read this, I had a friend who told me that this book was 100 times better than Twilight. (I'd say that it's actually more like a gorgonzolazillion times better and don't ask me the exact amount that represents. Let's just call it ""To infinity and beyond."") She also said that it was going to be an even bigger phenomenon than Twilight. I was like ""Hah!"" Let's face it, it can get ridiculous with the Fangirl mobbing and the crying. But I concur. I think this WILL be bigger than Twilight and obviously better. Maybe even Oscar worthy. I certainly hope so, anyway.I know that I said I wouldn't try and talk you into reading this book but I honestly can't help it. I'm not sure that I'm doing a great job at it, though. Let's try a little visual aid.Here is an artist's rendering of our heroine, Katniss Everdeen:And here's the gorgeous young lady who has been cast. Jennifer Lawrence.She may not seem like the spitting image of the girl from the book, but there is such a thing as hair dye and dirt. And and there is Photoshop, of course. So here is a pic that someone made and posted online of Jennifer as Katniss. It may change your mind.And this side by side.All right, besides the oversized cartoon eye, she is pretty damn close. Well, I'm convinced. How bout you?As if that wasn't enough, you can see some examples of what Jennifer would look like in the many outfits of Katniss: HEREAlso, here's the artists version of Peeta, our hero.I know that a lot of people would disagree but, to me, this guy is Peeta.And just so everyone knows - The Hunger Games is currently on sale for just 5 dollars on Kindle.Download it 
  HERE
.I'm not sure how long the sale will last, though. I already own the book but I am seriously considering buying the Kindle edition just for the hell of it. This is absolutely one of my all time favorite books!!","Aug 30, 2010"

  My ‘The Hunger Games’ week
23rd march- movie is released24th march- I read this review and end up watching excellent trailers, Later I downloaded the excerpt and kind of liked the first chapter25th march- I am a proud owner of the book. Yay!26th to 27th march- I started reading the bookThis is how I thought it would go:Once I would start reading it, I would just be sucked into it and finish the book remaining awake until early hours of morning, with my bloodshot red eyes.This is how it went:I started it and was immediately sucked into the book but then around midway I started losing interest. I fell asleep and had horrible dream (credit to graphic violence). Next morning I finished it owning to its fast pace.
  This book is special:
This is my first dystopian novel. I was very much excited about it since it was my introduction to a new genre. I would like to thank this book for such amazing description of dystopian world.
  The book:
This is a kind of book which probably everyone has read including their dogs, cats and birds too!So there is no need to hide the spoilers but as warning-**SPOILERS AHEAD**This book started brilliantly and within few pages sucked me into it. The world building part is brilliant. Introduction to districts, new society, people’s life, the rules, the reaping, and yes ‘The hunger Games’. It is fast paced with simplistic writing. These are all good things. The best part kids are starting to read the books.But that’s where the good things end.Suzanne Collins created the opportunity (golden ones) and one by one she destroyed it. But still most of the people are enthralled by the book as it eventually came out. But I’m not.So I’m going to tell very explicitly what I didn’t like...
  Using the first person perspective and thus losing the chance to give depth to any character
This story has been told through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, she just doesn't give a damn about anyone else except her family so naturally the other characters are too shallow and one dimensional.Many people just love Peeta and Katniss but I don’t like either of them. All I knew about Peeta was that he liked Katniss from age of five, saved her twice and is now in love with Katniss, rest is mystery.About Katniss, she does a lot of thing (infact she does everything in the book) but never has a second thought about them, never reflect over what she has done, eventually no attachment with the character.People tend to like Rue, Peeta, Cinna because these are few characters that spent time with Katniss, but (again)no character has depth.One more outcome that I feel from other reviews is that Katniss is definitely heroine of the story but why make other 10 kids villain. While Cato and Clove make their kill they become monster but when Katniss makes her kill, it has to be justified as revenge for killing Rue and pity killing of Cato.This book is all about KATNISS, KATNISS and KATNISS...
  Very predictable plot
The plot is so much predictable that I was surprised after every 10 or 20 pages (I’m not out of my mind) because the story would turn out exactly how I would guess. First I thought that maybe my mind is highly synchronised with Collins’s mind but later on reading other reviews it turned out the plot was predictable.
  Missed opportunities
This could have been much more interesting novel. Where did it all go wrong? As I’m writing, everything wrong in story to me looks like is outcome of first person perspective.--I would have felt much more connected to the games had it contained a bit of background information of every important tributes. Despite the killings being graphical, I didn’t felt sad for their deaths.--When Katniss makes her first kill, she moves over to do other things (because Rue is dying). But later when she realises that it was her first kill, still she doesn’t reflect over it even for a minute. Killing other human has effect on the killer, until and unless killer is sociopath, moreover here the killers are kids. Instead of giving insight to their mind the story flatly moves ahead with killing and ending the games.
  It doesn’t make me think
I read books because I enjoy it and because they push my mind to a new level of thinking which benefit me. This book made me think only about, why I didn’t like this book when whole world is enjoying this. No further thoughts beyond that.Maciek’s thought on this book:
  “The Hunger Games reads like a bag of chips, meaning you can devour it in several short bites but it will leave you unnourished and aside from gas, it won’t have much effect.”
FOR ALL THIS 2 STARS(**)In many reviews people come out with most lame excuse (defense) I have ever heard- IT’s A YOUNG-ADULT NOVELAs for other books in the series, I will definitely read them but I’m not in hurry or excited with this prospect. I will read it someday, probably before second installment of the movie.To put a perfect end to ‘The Hunger Games’ week28th march- I watched the movieMovie turned out pretty good, much better than I had anticipated. As I watched the movie it seemed that novel was written with movie in mind. Few minor changes, like in the end President Snow shown thinking representing its start of story unlike novel which ends. Some scenes are breath taking, too much violence. Acting by Jennifer Lawrence is good (she turned out better than Katniss in the book). I liked the movie, rated it 7/10.This review is inspired by Maciek’s review and Brian’s review.P.S. The kind of reviews and comments I have seen makes me think this book is being followed like religion and my review will sound like blasphemy to them. But I can’t help it, I tried to be honest.","Mar 26, 2012"
"9780439023481","1882788","Tessa","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1882788-tessa","I sat down to this book prepared to be captivated in its pages. But I was disappointed. I was always expecting that finally the author would show her genius and knock me off my feet. But it never happened. Yes, it was exciting and entertaining. But it wasn't a truly great book. I could not stop comparing this to Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. Like Fahrenheit 451, it was a dystopian novel set in the future, but Fahrenheit 451 had significant symbolism on every page, paragraph, and even half the sentences. I was so scared because it was so life-like and realistic. I could see how undeniably prophetic Bradbury was and how we are slowly, ever so slowly, slipping closer and closer to that world. I saw the similarities of the worlds; I felt inspired to stop us from falling into that trap too. But The Hunger Games never provoked me to think or inspired me to act. It was like a roller-coaster. You get on and momentarily take an exciting spin. But that's all. You're just taken there. You're not drawn in. You don't have to do anything. You just sit there and your stomach flops over and over as opposed to your mind working, thinking, puzzling, imagining. The writing style wasn't even good, and the grammar was actually quite poor. What really annoyed me about the writing style was that I knew paragraphs before if something exciting was going to happen. Just the way that Suzanne Collins wrote blew away the whole surprise and shock of an attack. I ended up asking, ""So what?"" She could have awoken the reader to real problems by showing us what could happen if we don't take action. But she never really got to the point. She focused instead on entertaining us, on giving us a sob story. There was so much potential in this book. What I'm trying to say is that there was so much that Suzanne Collins could have done to make this book a masterpiece like Fahrenheit 451. But she just didn't. I do want to read the next book though. I'll take another ride on the roller-coaster.","Aug 30, 2010"

"9780439023481","3099666","Buggy","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy","~SO THIS IS WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT~THE HUNGER GAMES is a fantastic, breathless and somewhat brutal read that once you start you simply can’t put down again. Initially I had no idea what this book was about or what to expect in terms of YA writing, it had just been recommended to me by so many people and had such a buzz surrounding it that I had to find out for myself why. Well let me say I was not disappointed and have now joined the legions of Suzanne Collins fans in awaiting her next instalment. Written along the lines of Stephen King’s The Long Walk or Orwell’s 1984 (I may be aging myself here) this story still feels very original and sucked me in completely with its modern day Survivor-esque retelling. The Hunger Games is the ultimate in reality TV, suspense, scripted realism, romance and survival that you should not miss.Set in a post apocalyptic future (although we frustratingly never learn the why's, how’s or even when of this future.) This new communist-type America known as Panem has been divided into a Capital and its 12 districts. We follow 16 year old Katniss as she struggles to keep her starving family alive, hunting and gathering with her best friend Gale. Unbeknownst to her these are valuable skills as the annual hunger games are about to begin. Each year these games require two children from each district who are chosen based on a lottery system for compulsory participation. These televised games are then broadcast throughout Panem (with mandatory viewing) as the 24 contestants fight each other to the death, leaving just one victor at its violent conclusion. It’s kind of like Survivor but instead of being voted off the island you have to kill your competitors. When Katniss’s younger sister is chosen as the female contestant from their district Katniss volunteers to take her place. Then together with Peeta the other lottery winner they travel to the capital and begin preparations for the opening ceremonies and ultimately their death in The Hunger Games. Oddly this has been written without paragraph breaks and I have to admit the first part of it dragged for me, as Katniss is groomed, clothed, and schooled by her entourage within the capital. However as soon as the games begin, lookout! By this point in the story you have become attached to several key characters and its then that you realize things can’t end well as there will be only one winner. Over a period of about 2 weeks and against overwhelming odds we watch 24 victims dwindle as they struggle to survive. Simultaneously avoiding and hunting each other they form alliances, face hunger and mind numbing thirst, mutant animal attacks, friendship, love and ultimately a distrust of everyone as Big Brother raises the stakes to keep the audience interested. This is an exciting book that will keep you up late into the night and resonate with you long after you’ve finished. Cheers","Jan 10, 2010"
"9780439023481","5126170","Caity","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5126170-caity","So, unlike some reviewers of this book, I was not repulsed by the premise, nor did I think this book was overly graphic or gratuitously violent. Before I commence my review, two things: 1) I am generally a fan of post-apocalyptic struggle-of-the-downtrodden literature, and 2) I am generally a fan of imposing female characters. Now then.I would agree with those who suggested that this book is Twilight in a Battle Royale setting. The characters are admittedly more likeable (although that's arguable), but that is overshadowed by the fact that this book stubbornly seems unable to admit that it's Twilight. The setting and the premise were interesting to me, and I was actually excited to find out what sort of strategy these kids could come up with to bring down the establishment. I guess the bringing down of the establishment will be in the second and third books, in which case I kind of wish Collins had condensed them all into one. The problem is that the initially mildly intriguing setting and almost any and all possibilities that could arise from it are sacrificed to highlight the love triangle that permeates the book. Did the oppressed poorer District kids team up with each other against the Careers? No. Did Katniss struggle morally with having to kill or be killed? Not really. Do we find out anything much about any characters other than Katniss and Peeta? Very seldom. I wanted more Rue, more Thresh, I wanted Foxface's real name, even more Cato and Clove. Wasted characters, characters that could have brought out more interesting aspects of Katniss. I wanted to know more about these characters instead of hearing more of Katniss's monotonous inner monologue.The absence of other characters' development bothers me just as much as their disposal. We don't even find out how a lot of them die. Rue is the only one who dies in a remotely dignified way, and then with flowers and embedded song lyrics Collins manages to make it ridiculous. One verse is enough, thank you.And Katniss (and jeez, couldn't Collins have found a better plant to name her after?), admittedly badass, starts out in a semi-promising way, but then manages to disappoint by being completely oblivious not only to the fact that she is badass but that two handsome men are completely in love with her. She's presented as such a no-nonsense person, and then suddenly she's overcome with humility when frankness could mean the difference between life and death? And then after that she becomes gorgeous, gets an insanely high score in the skill tests, or whatever, that they have to do, and becomes a silly giggling girl in her interview. Then she manages to win the Hunger Games after killing only one tribute, under conveniently justified circumstances?...what?And the wolves at the end. Ridiculous. Cato dying with the pair of them barely having to lift a finger. Too perfect. The Gamekeeper's radical rule change, and then the revoking of said rule change. So predictable.And also, under circumstances primed to teach valuable lessons or at least communicate one solid moral, Collins manages to teach none, even after killing off twenty-one teens and a tween. I enjoyed Katniss's intuition about Haymitch's withholding/presenting of gifts, though I found the leaps she made sometimes questionable. I enjoyed Rue, for the short time she appeared (too short). I enjoyed Katniss's resourcefulness. But I wanted gore. Don't set up a battle royale and skip the juicy parts. I wanted character interaction. Relationships based on tenuous trust, common interests, mutual hatred, not two puppies who are so in obviously in love with our heroine the reader thinks her stupid not to know. I wanted them to bring down Big Brother. Why set up a landscape so prime for rebellion and not even have one? A double suicide pales in comparison to what Collins could have done with her world and her characters. I wanted more than flat characters and a dystopia that wasn't fleshed out enough. Sorry, when our badass heroine's most pressing ordeal is knowing how to kiss a cute boy at the right moment, I'm just not interested. Everything in this book has been done before and done far better. The love triangle: Star Wars. The Divine Comedy. Hell, even Twilight. Too many to count. The staged Melee: Battle Royale. The Running Man. Countless anime. Even wolf-people were made captivating in John Connolly's The Book of Lost Things. But hey, if it gets kids to read, maybe they'll get around to something more intellectually stimulating.This review is much longer than my others, probably because I can't really understand why everyone thinks this book is so frickin' great. Quick update: I finally watched the first and second movie adaptations, and, I'll be honest, I loved the crap out of them. And I felt confused about that, because they're actually really faithful to the books, more so than a lot of book-to-film adaptations are. So how can I enjoy the narrative the movies are telling me so much, but have so many objections to the books?I had a discussion with a friend of mine about this subject, and we came to the conclusion that it wasn't just because I tend to enjoy Jennifer Lawrence's performances. Not being privy to Katniss's inner thoughts actually takes the ""young adult"" out of the books. The paragraphs of primping become her appearing in a scene in a dress (for instance, the wedding dress. She just puts it on and walks out, instead of laboring over it). The long laments for Peeta's safety become instead active, perilous tasks. The absolute despair Katniss feels is palpable and heart-wrenching, rather than over-wrought. Katniss seems much more in control, and much more real, in the hand of Lawrence than in the hands of her original creator. In short, I guess I actually like the tale Collins has told; I just wish, on the page, she had told it another way.I welcome further discussion on this subject. I'm still kind of surprised.","May 11, 2011"
"9780439023481","4605519","Jamie","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4605519-jamie","Well this book lived up to a lot of the hype that surrounds it. While the name and cover still do not grab my attention the story, once started, did.This book is written in first perspective, from the heroine's aspect. Her name is Katniss Everdeen. She starts off in her home, a simple, poor area of the land. She is the provider for her mother and sister with her hunting skills. To protect her younger sister, she is sent to the capitol, along with local boy Peeta, to 'participate' in the annual Hunger Games.These 'games' are fights to the death, aired and shown to the capitol and all 12 districts under its control, in a survival arena of sorts. The book shows, throughout the story, a somewhat futuristic dystopia society. The tributes (Katniss, Peeta and others in the game) are given basic weapons (bows, spears, clubs) and the district where Katniss is from uses herbs and eats basic foods (squirrel, wild turkey, etc) but the capitol has voice command room service, automatic hair dryers, and a camera/screen set that tracks and shows the tributes (no matter where they go) to the viewers. It is an interesting combination.There is a 'romantic' setting as well. Katniss and Peeta are to appear as a united team to the people. Peeta even admits to liking her during his interview. So a setting for 'star-crossed lovers' is created. However, Katniss has various feelings toward Peeta throughout the book and its very realistic and understandable, especially when there is possibly another guy back home. Yet while there are time I can relate to her, at the same time several of her thoughts want to make my roll my eyes or drop my head onto a desk. While she is survival smart, she is not people smart. She can't socialize and cannot read people worth a darn. While it is annoying at times, it is also endearing and has created a unique character.Overall, very good book. 4 1/2 stars is my official opinion, but I will give it 5 since I can't do halves. Its a constant pace of survival, and action with just the right touch of romantic possibilities. I look forward to the next book.","Jan 08, 2011"

Well, that's not entirely true...I am not a Serial Killer is about a teen boy who's sure he's the evilest thing ever born, is told from his PoV, and yet that gets darn close to 4 stars. I don't like books about teen girls. Well, that's not entirely true, either...Deathless is told from the PoV of a teen girl in a magical struggle for her life, and yet it got four full and eager stars.So why didn't I like this book?Because the whole thing is a cynical exercise in marketing a product that has elements the publisher recognized as hot and trending: Strong teen girl; dystopian setting; children in battle for their lives. Sound familiar? Think Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and forward. Same situation. Female hero. Technology not magic. No humor, ungraceful writing, and cold business calculation set it apart from the Potter books.I don't know Ms. Collins, and I impute no impure motives to her. She might very well have written the story dearest to her heart, for all I know. But I do know, and have for quite some years, publishers. This is a product promoted to fill a gap in the line-up, like the Chrysler 200.Awful. That it succeeded so well is depressing. That it's so unquestioningly lauded is either life-sappingly grim or suicide-inducingly terrible. In a country where free speech is ever under attack (hence the First Amendment, and laws supporting it...no one legislates the safety of a thing unquestioned), we waste our collective breath lauding a second-rate industrial product, a foolish simplistic ramshackle pastiche of better books that, in a better world, would merit only silence and oblivion.Shame. Shame. And more shame on me for adding to the chorus.If in a minor key.

"9780439023481","3888591","Brandi","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3888591-brandi","First of all, I know you're looking at my rating and wondering what's wrong with me. For one thing, this book's gotten at least 4 stars from everyone else. For another, everyone seems to think that it's the best book of the year. I won't dispute what everyone else has said about this book, because it's not a complete disaster. It's just that it's one of the worst novels I've ever read. The story begins great. I love the dystopian setting, even if it is a bit unrealistic. Katniss is a great protagonist - although, I'm getting tired of reading books where the main characters have just the right skills (say, archery) to persevere right through to the end. It's rather cliche by now. But other than that, the author really sets the scene and develops her characters well. I have to say that my favorite part (I'm sure it's almost everybody's favorite part) occurs when Katniss shoots her arrow in the judges' direction. It was a great move, even if she didn't think so (which I found surprising - why did she cry over it? She must have known it would score her more points with the judges). It was during the actual competition that the book hit a rift and sunk into a landslide. No offense, but none of it was appealing to me - the wasps, the romance, the danger. Everything, from Katniss's first spring into the trees to the final scene when the remaining two tributes defy the Games, was unnecessary and revolting. It's not the murders that disappointed me; I went into the story knowing that at least twenty people would die in the book. No, what truly revolted me was that the competition was meant to be entertaining - not just to the vain audiences in the corrupted society, but to us readers, as well. So much of it was written in a way that we would find it appealing... imagine, finding death appealing. To be fair, I know that the book is supposed to serve as a warning, and in some respects, I think it did. But then I remember everyone recommending this book to me (""It's good, you've got to read it!"" ""It's so cool!"" ""You'll love it! It has adventure and suspense!"") and it makes me sick. I am in no way trying to insult the author (who obviously has talent) or the people who love this book (many of whom are my friends), but I can honestly tell you that I would never recommend this book to anyone without regretting it. To me, it's like one of those shows that medieval people used to put on, where a person would be trapped in a cage so that a tiger could kill him in front of a laughing audience.","Jun 27, 2011"

The new country, Panem (as in the “bread” part of Rome’s Bread and Circuses, or supposedly, Pan-America) is not exactly a fun place to live. A decadent Capitol rules over 12 subservient, worker districts. Katliss is a 16-year-old who lives with her depression-incapacitated mother and her 12-year-old sister, Prim, whom she loves more than anything. She lives in the coal-producing District 12, a sooty place in the former Appalachia where life expectancy is as bleak as the food ration is small. She learned hunting skills from her late father and supplements her family’s meager ration with game, hunting frequently with her 18-yr-old friend Gale. Suzanne Collins - from fictiondb.comHearkening back to ancient Greece, as a way of demonstrating its dominance over the twelve districts, every year each district must send one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 18 the Hunger Games. Contestants, or tributes, in the very Rome-centric nomenclature of the book, are selected by lottery, but one can get food for increasing the number of entries one is willing to submit. This is not necessarily a lottery you would want to win, as the Hunger Games contest is a gladiatorial battle to the death. Joining an ancient form of barbarity with a more modern version, the contest is seen by the nation on television, gussied up with all the pomp and circumstance of the World Cup, Superbowl and World Series combined, with the degrading intrusiveness of reality television.Primrose Everdeen gets the bad news - from Jabberjays.netWhen the unlucky Prim is selected, Katliss offers to take her place, joining the muscular baker’s son, Peeta. They are transported to the Capitol, dressed up, interviewed on TV, offered training in several forms of combat and sent out there to do or die. The rest is their ordeal, which includes having to succeed not only with physical skills such as strength and agility. In addition to the need for cunning in figuring out how to best their competitors, they have to figure out how to please the television audience, among which are sponsors who might send them much needed goods during the game. Katliss is caught not only in a brutal contest with the other tributes, but in a confusing battle with her own adolescent emotions. What are her feelings, really, for her male counterpart from District 12, Peeta, and for her hunky bff Gale back home (team Gale vs team Peeta anyone)? How can she express her rage at the operators of this horror for their inhumanity? Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta - from ABC NewsThis is a fast-paced and engaging read, even for one who is waaaay past the target YA demographic. I quite enjoyed reading the book, hated putting it down. Collins offers characters one can root for, with enough inner conflict and complexity to matter, well some of them, without it being overbearing, or slowing down the story.Ok, I liked the book. But I had a niggling concern early on. When I began reading, I wondered if there might be a political agenda at play. The “Capitol” is clearly the evil tyrant here, with the oppressed working people living in dread of their overlords. Had this story been published in the early-to-mid 20th century, one might presume that the “Capitol” stood in for the fascism of Germany, Italy or Spain, or the totalitarianism of the Soviet Union/Russia or China. However, given the political climate of the twenty-teens, in which cynical forces of the right seek at every opportunity to portray government of any sort as the personification of evil, one must wonder if the author subscribed to the notion. I confess to not having read her prior work, so lack a basis there, and the interviews with Collins I read offer no insight. So, I am not saying that this is so, just that the portrayal made me wonder. I will read more of Collins’ work and look into the subject some more outside pages she wrote, and if I find anything definitive I will update this entry.PS - Subsequent to writing the above, I read the following two Hunger Games books. I posted a review of Catching Fire in 2013, and while I did read Mockingjay I never got around to reviewing it. While I no longer feel a concern that Collins was consciously attempting to impart a stealth right-wing perspective, I still had a feeling that there was something else going on here. Thankfully, a GR friend, Kyra, offered a link to an article in The Guardian that articulated very clearly what my innards were only able to communicate with vague visceral discomfort. Here is the link. I suggest you check it out for yourselves.

"9780439023481","542037","Annalisa","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/542037-annalisa","I started this book thinking the idea was preposterous: a government choosing to squelch rebellion by forcing its citizens to give up their children as contenders in the ultimate reality show of death to the last survivor. Yeah right, and yet it reminded me a lot of the absurdity of the Nazi party, child armies in Africa, and even back to the gladiators of the Roman empire. I realized I believed a government could be this arrogant and wrathful, that society could be this absurd, that the common people would be too afraid to fight back. When people are pitted against each other instead of turning on the establishment they often fight each other within the failed system, fighting for that elusive top spot or ignoring the pain of others grateful to escape tragedy themselves. I soon found myself intensely involved in the Hunger Games and hoping for a certain outcome that would certainly bring about the death of many children but save our brave heroine. Once you're in, what option do you have but to play and survive? Collins did an amazing job of taking an unbelievable and predictable storyline and making it believable and unpredictable. Complete with an impossible love interest, twists in the arena to keep you guessing, and both sympathy and hatred for the other characters, the book is hard to put down. I stayed up late to reach the conclusion that would seem obvious but was still evasive when I could conceive many alternate endings. In some ways the story reminded me of Lord of the Flies, but without as frustrating of a dues ex machina ending. I found it interesting that even in this life and death situation, the kids refused to do anything that would displease the Capitol and make them look rebellious or unwilling to play, or worse emotional and disturbed by death. They did not bond with each other, help each other, or ever want to be indebted by anyone's kindness. Sad that the gravest error would be vulnerability of spirit because the tough ones are the ones to survive. While Katniss gets out of having to do a lot of the killing, she still plays her part, and even being the cause of one death is too many. I found it interesting that they switch to survival mode and kill without thought or regret. I'm sure the regret and nightmares will come later, but we as the readers have to feel the sadness of the deaths now, and live with our own relief that a child died who wasn't Katniss. There is obviously a lot of death hashed out, but only a handful experienced by our narrator. There is one death that is rather gruesome, but for the most part, I thought the subject matter handled appropriately for YA. Nonetheless the subject matter is not appropriate for younger children.My one compliant about the novel would be the overuse of fragments. As a grammar freak, I'll let powerful fragments go. On occasion. As a literary device. But you throw five and six back to back. Just for effect. And all I'm doing is counting. How many are going by before we're back to complete sentences. There were a few paragraphs with way too many. But that's just a style difference. And the story is worth it. A good tale and a thinker. Even after I closed this book, I found myself mulling over the statements about society, our gruesome need for reality TV, our shallow obsession with looks, how much a community will let others suffer as long as they are safe, and the strength of the human spirit when backed up against the wall. I enjoyed Katniss' emotionally detached character, Peeta's vulnerable goodness, and Rue's small but fighting spirit. Now I want to learn more about Gale. A good strong female protagonist and a great set up for the sequel which I will be reading. How will the Capital be brought down? Who will Katniss chose? Can she stand by and let another gruesome show go by training the tributes from her village without action? Can this society be saved or is it beyond redemption? I'm intrigued.ETA: I've been thinking a lot about the messages in the Hunger Games with all the hype for the movie. Good dystopias are warnings, something to make you mull over trends in society by making these public wrongs absurd and larger than life. Here are some of the comparisons I found between Panem and our society:-Overindulgence. The plastic surgery, the bright peacocky colors, the time and money spent primping, the obnoxious outfits that one could never work in or survive in come catastrophe. The shoes Effie Trinket wears in the movie are popular today and nobody can walk properly in them. Our obsession with looks is headed toward the unimaginable level of the Capitol. And the overindulgence doesn't stop at appearances. The overeating, the mcmansions, party-the-time lifestyle. Our shallow, keeping-up-with-the Joneses society is heading there. -Entitlement. The people of the Capitol don't care where their resources come from, who works and dies for it, or how limited the supply is. They don't conserve; they don't say ""thank you""; they don't look beyond themselves. The degree of separation from them and their food and resources means they have no appreciation for it. It's like us with our grocery stores full of already slaughtered food and the diamonds we were fought hard for in Africa. You can say the entitlement is a lesson for the 1% out there and you can say the entitlement is a lesson for the anti-1% who feel entitled for their government to support them. Even the poor in America are still better off than most of the world. We are all the 1% and the sense of entitlement from Americans could be our downfall.-Desensitization. Reality TV, video games, gruesome movies (like the Hunger Games :) ) have desensitized us. As horrific as the Hunger Games is (not the book but the actual Games in a society), how far off are we when girls throw parties to watch other girls get their hearts broken on The Bachelor, or when we feel nothing as people starve through a month on Survivor, or break out in fights on shows on MTV. We stop shy of death, but how long before push the envelope there too? How long before a gladiator-style game becomes popular for us too? After all, we are following the footsteps of the Roman Empire. I've been reading articles on Yahoo! like crazy the past few weeks about how to do Katniss' braid or what food to eat in celebration of the movie release. We are as bad as the Capitol in some cases.","Apr 08, 2009"

"9780439023481","405390","Kemper","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper","When it comes to The Hunger Games, I feel like I’m walking into the ballroom in my tuxedo with a bottle of champagne in each hand only to find no one there except for a lone janitor sweeping up confetti along with a couple of people passed out under tables and there's only a bottle of crème de menthe left at the bar. In other words, I’m late to the party.Since I’m so tardy, I don’t think there’s anything I can add, particularly since YA isn’t my usual thing. So I’ll just give it four stars and note a few things that stuck out for me:* I particularly liked the way that Collins portrayed the reality television aspect to the games. The idea that the smart contestants have to play a role in order to get public support even as they’re fighting for their lives was a good way to work some subtle points about the nature of watching people who know they’re being observed.* Collins also did a nice job of depicting the ‘hunger’ aspect of this. The descriptions of the food deprived District 12, Katniss’s constant struggle to literally put bread on the table, and then her fascination with the rich food of the Capital kept you aware of how food was always on her mind. It also had me constantly raiding the fridge. * This reminded me a lot of Stephen King’s The Long Walk (Written under his Richard Bachman alias originally.) in a good way. That story also featured young people competing in a brutal public contest that was orchestrated by the government for the amusement of the masses. This gave me the urge to reread it.* I’ve got a teenage niece who went through an unfortunate Twilight phase, but she came through unscathed and is a big fan of this series. I’m tremendously glad about that because I obviously prefer her using the tough and independent Katniss as a role model rather than Bella Swan. I’d rather see her running through the woods hunting humans with a bow-n-arrow rather than pining over pale losers.","Apr 12, 2012"

Such a popular series, so many people have read it or watched the movies... do I really need to do a review?  But since I've put it in my top 20 favorite books, isn't there an obligation to review it? YES  Let's make it simple... it may be young adult, and it may be fantasy, but neither of those facts matter when you have a set of richly flawed characters, a plot that is an absolute play on ""survival of the fittest"" and imagery so vivid it jumps off the proverbial page.You can't not read it. You may not absolutely LOVE it, but it will capture your attention in many ways.

"9780439023481","131922","mark monday","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/131922-mark-monday","i just woke up from a disturbing little nightmare that strangely involved The Hunger Games. in the dream, i pull Hunger Games off of the shelf and out slips a paper thin cell phone. it is my sister's phone. she has recently come up from los angeles to visit and i know she's returned home while i was at work; clearly she's forgotten her phone. i'm amused, knowing how forgetful she can be, realizing that i'll now have a phone that i can use (my cell phone just died in real life - and in my dream too), and immediately call her husband on her cell to tell him that Sheila forgot her phone. before i can say anything, he says in a small voice, ""Where's Sheila? I've been calling her and you for hours. The boys are scared"". in the background, i hear the tv talking about murders. and then about plane crashes. and then about disappearances. i try to say something to him but my voice isn't working; i start to yell but nothing comes out. i know something has happened to her and i know that i have somehow failed her. my mind bends at the awful possibilities and i wake up, sweating.so i took down Hunger Games and suddenly flashed back to that short, dreadful scene of Katniss hearing her sister's name called during the reaping. i knew it was coming; hell, it says so right on the back cover. nevertheless, it is a scene that is in some ways a moment out of time for me. short, basic, horrifying, primal...the idea of Prim being chosen, being slain, is not even a possibility on Katniss' mind. her mind doesn't accept the idea of her sister in danger, and so without thinking, she volunteers to take her place. i remember reading that scene, and that little shiver it gave me. Katniss acts in the way that all people who love those in their care would act: immediately and unthinkingly putting themselves in harm's way to protect their loved ones. it is an automatic, human reaction. it doesn't take an expert on the human condition to understand that. but it does take an excellent writer to convey such a basic human response so simply and yet so meaningfully. Katniss' action defines her completely, as it defines all people who would seek to protect others. throughout the novel, she does not veer from this course.i was in alaska recently, camping. there was a person with us during this trip who was extremely worried abouts bears and bear attacks; and so conversation took place to reassure her, to keep things light. we talked about bears off and on throughout the day and then around the campfire. i've never been the sort to be paranoid about bears, but man when i went to sleep, that's all i could think about. and then twigs started cracking, followed by the sound of an animal snuffling and rustling about, right next to me; it happened throughout the night; i stayed awake until dawn. the next day i noticed some dry animal shit and discovered that i had placed my tent only a couple inches away from some little creature's burrow, one that clearly had much work to accomplish during the evening hours. not so frightening to think about now, sorta cute actually. but gosh, it is something else to be locked in fear for so many hours straight. my mind went through various stages, finally settling on a (now hilarious) acceptance that i would be attacked. i clutched my knife and waited, exhausted but somehow at peace that i could run, i could fight, i could live, i could die, but strangely content knowing that what will happen, will happen...as ridiculous as this particular situation turned out to be, i have had that same feeling during other situations where i felt Okay, well this is it, i suppose i'm going to die. this is a basic human response. you can only quiver in fear for so long until you weary, you become resolved to accept things.on the plane ride back, i noticed a kid reading The Hunger Games and remembered my own enjoyment, and knew how gripping and intense the experience could possibly be for him. he certainly clutched the book as if his life depended on it, as if the rest of the world didn't exist. and then i also remembered those scenes in the arena, that acceptance that Katniss had: she may die, she may not die, but what will happen, will happen. i remember reading her thoughts about her future in the arena, her probable death, and realizing her thoughts felt right. The Hunger Games manages to get across a very complex yet also very basic human response, in a way that is direct, crystal clear, and thoroughly realistic in its detailing of a person's actual mental and emotional reactions.so why do i ramble on about things in my life that have barely anything to do with Hunger Games, that only tangentially reminded me of this novel? well, i suppose to make a point about the book. if you are the kind of person who became lost in The Hunger Games, you know that it stays with you, it affects you in an emotional way...it comes back. but i'm also rambling to make a point about all quality Young Adult Fiction. this genre is well-loved, but it also takes its critical knocks as well. folks talk about the simplistic writing, the boiled-down tropes, the lack of complexity, the earnestness, and the basic, almost black & white palate of emotions and principles on display. but to me, these are the virtues of the genre. if done well, these are the reasons why these books connect with their readers in a way that feels right, that feels honest. no matter whether the setting is a wizard's school or an alternate england or a post-apocalyptic north america.i think of YA Fiction as our own modern version of fables and mythic adventures, stories that have as their purpose the telling of straightforward morality tales, tales of right and wrong and fighting back and loving others and being an individual and finding community. the best ones are transparent in their goals and do not clutter their prose with stylization, complicated narratives, writerly game-playing, ambiguous theme-building, and the like. the best ones tell a tale that resonates with readers at a deep and elemental level - and so the reader responds in kind. i suppose this is why many people can become obsessed with this genre's bestsellers - they speak to the reader in the most direct way imaginable. they may come with a context that is relevant to today's world (as does Hunger Games), but the best ones are also timeless (as is Hunger Games). the best of this genre warmly illustrates the strength of the human spirit yet can also be surprisingly unsentimental; often swiftly-paced and action-packed yet carefully, lovingly detailed when examining the things that matter to its protagonists; often despairing and full of a palpable sense of resentment and anger, yet open to the inevitable change and growth that can happen and that make us more connected to the world around us and to whom we truly are, at the heart of us. The Hunger Games' place within all of this is obvious: it is a modern classic of the genre. and as with all classics, it is relevant and suitable for all ages. it is the kind of novel that grows in the memory.","Aug 23, 2011"
"9780439023481","2250020","Tatiana","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana","Original, 2008This book was recommended to me after I read Unwind by Neal Shusterman and although maybe it is not as emotionally affecting as Unwind, I still think it is a fantastic book. The story has just the perfect combination of action, drama, and romance. It has a great message that you can stay human even in the most inhumane conditions. Needless to say, I am anxiously awaiting the sequel. I am sure even greater things are to come in the next book. Update 9/09. Just finished rereading this book and it is as great as I remember it to be. What especially stands out is how tightly plotted and edited it is. Every chapter is a perfection with no wasted words or paragraphs, no filler. Every chapter has an incredible impact and always ends with an emotional ""bang."" I think I am now prepared for ""Catching Fire"" and hope my expectations are not too high...Update 8/10. What else is there to say about this fantastic book? What is the better testament to this novel's greatness than the fact that it is just as affecting after the 3rd reading as it was after the 1st, if not more. My heart is aching for Katniss, Peeta, and whole Panem. Please, Suzanne, don't disappoint us with Mockingjay. And can Peeta stay alive too? I don't care if he gets the girl, but I love him and want him to make it through. Update 3/12. Post-movie. Still adore the book. I love and hate the feeling it gives me. The book is better, obviously, than the movie. But the movie has its merits too. Generally smart casting decisions.","Apr 30, 2009"

The violence isn’t explicit and exists on the peripherals of what is otherwise a brilliant and captivating read.The main character, Katniss, is incredible. She's strong, proud, clever, yet cold, calculating and soft. As far as great female characters go, she rivals Elizabeth Bennet and takes her thrown for my favourite ever. Where the Empress by Karen Miller was let down by a cold, calculating female character with no likeability, The Hunger Games is carried by Katniss' passion, determination and struggle. The world itself seems unbelievable enough but if you can get past the concept of a government requiring a tribute of 12-18 year old boys and girls to take part in a gruesome bloodbath then you should be fine.The supporting characters are rich and interesting. The world itself is three dimensional and tactile when reading and you will probably find yourself immersed in the science fiction world that doesn’t seem that distant from our own.The plot and pacing never dulls and the end of the book may just cause heart palpitations as you race towards the end to discover who will survive and who will die.The ending left me a little disconcerted but only because I wanted more.","Feb 11, 2010"
"9780439023481","27788046","Bookdragon Sean","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean","I’ve had this book recommended to me several times over the years. I don’t know why. Not only is this book completely terrible, but it is also not the sort of thing I would normally read. I did, however, approach this book with an open mind. I expected to like it, but not love it. What I didn’t expect was to hate it so passionately. There are just too many things wrong with it. In all honesty I do not understand the success this book has achieved. For me, it is complete rubbish.  Far too unrealistic I find it impossible to accept this world. It wasn’t because it was a nasty place, but because it wasn’t believable. The Capitol puts on these Hunger Games and sacrifices countless children in the process. I mean….what? Children. Why would the Capitol do this? If I was in charge of the Capitol I would have developed a much more effective system. I’d have fixed the games so the leaders of each district were sacrificed each year. That way there would be no one left to lead an uprising against the Capitol. And those left in the districts wouldn’t have the courage or reason to lead an uprising. They’d want to keep their heads down because they would be sacrificed next if they too led a rebellion. Problem solved. Capitol rules the districts in oppressive peace. That’s beside the point, though, because the cruelty of sacrificing is also too far-fetched. The residents of the Capitol are vain and greedy, but vain and greedy is a long way off from sadistic and brutal. I found it difficult to accept that in the Capitol there wasn’t streets filled with violent protestors trying to save the lives of these kids. It just didn’t work for me. The children are far too accepting and almost stoic when they are selected. I would go kicking and screaming. Their families just watch them go and accept; then they rebel later, idiots. The children also don’t seem to be that afraid. They may have become used to the process, but surely the horror of this situation would lead to panic attacks and break downs? Then there are the games themselves. The whole thing is recorded by invisible cameras. There is a whole world of wrong with that. It seems to me like Collins wrote herself into a box and the only solution she could come up with was “I know I’ll make the cameras invisible!” Then there is the idea of Peeta’s camouflage skills. Basically, Collins suggests that because Peeta was a baker and decorated his cakes artfully, despite the district being in poverty, he can then camouflage his entire body into the surroundings of the arena using his said cake decorating skills. Now, that was plain stupid. I don’t think she thought these ideas through enough. Annoyingly simple writingSuzanne Collins writes in an incredibly simple manner. There is no eloquence in her expression and prose; it is all very lifeless and flat, just like her world and characters. This may be for a younger audience, but that doesn’t excuse the blandness of her writing: it’s weak and unimaginative. I’m not sure if she purposely wrote in this way or if that’s just how she writes in general, but either way the result is a book that appears as if it’s been written by a ten year old. The sentence structure is basic, and very rarely changes. This can work if the language feels powerful, but if doesn’t. The whole novel feels elementary. The characters are just as bad. The obvious romance that has, and is, being created is just tiresome. I don’t think this should have included the romance complication. I think Collins should have focused more upon writing a realistic story before she delved into the complexities of teenage relationships. This, again, was simple and straightforward. I literally have nothing positive to say about this book. For me, it doesn’t have a single redeeming feature or quality: it is just utter drivel. Everything about this book is basic and weak. No doubt, I shall receive a string of comments from people defending this book, but this is just my opinion of it. I’m not wrong and neither are you. This is simply my opinion of a terribly overrated, poorly considered and badly written book. Deal with it. I welcome discussion, but not those who are going to simply say that I’m wrong with no reasoning behind their argument. Also, this is another of those rare cases when the movie is actually better than the book. This says a lot because the movie is awful. Needless to say, I absolutely hate this book and don’t recommend it to anyone. The Hunger Games1. The Hunger Games- A transparent one star2. Catching Fire- A cheap one star3.

So the Hunger Games follows the story of sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in District 12. (There's twelve districts altogether) Katniss lives with her mother and her twelve year old sister, Prim.There are 11 other Districts, as well as a Capitol. There once was a District 13, but they rebelled against the government and were wiped out by the Captiol, so because of this, the Captiol stages an event every year to remind the Districts the power the Captiol holds over them. The event is called the Hunger Games. Each District has 2 tributes. The tributes are put into an arena and fight each other to the death. The winner of the Hunger Games is the person who stays alive until the end.So, Katniss volunteers in place of her younger sister. The second person who is chosen from District 12 is Peeta Mellark.

Will she walk out of the Games alive?So, I've been avoiding the Hunger Games for years. It has several strikes against it:1. It's a young adult book2. The enormous amount of hype3. The fact that it appears on the surface to be a combination of two Stephen King books, The Long Walk and The Running ManThe other night, I was talking about the Robert Crais book I just finished and my lovely girlfriend asked when I was going to start reading the Hunger Games. Monday, I said. She was making country fried steak that night. What else could I do? Lucky for me, the country fried steak and the Hunger Games were both great.Suzanne Collins crafted quite a tale in the Hunger Games. From the start, I was impressed with her lead characters. Katniss's personality reflected her background nicely. She wasn't cutesy or even particularly charismatic when the story started and was definitely rough around the edges. Peeta's questionable motivations kept the story moving for much of the book.The Hunger Games themselves reminded me of the Stephen King books I mentioned earlier and also Lord of the Flies. I never had the safety net feeling that I had while reading other YA fare like Harry Potter. The way the story was told in the present tense gave it an urgent feel that kept me turning pages until my bedtime had come and gone.Any gripes? Just the usual curmudgeonly ones about it being the first in the series with a lot of dangling threads left to be resolved in the two subsequent books. It was an easy four star read.","Nov 11, 2012"

Okay so maybe not that much excitement is needed, but boy this book deserves a review I probably won't be able to give. There are plenty of good reviews of this book already, but I can't resist the urge to put my own two cents in too.You can already get the premise of the story from the other reviews so I won't bother with that. Can I just say that the author did an exquisite job of finding the right voice for Katniss? I already like her and I struggle with her while she is playing the Hunger Games. Katniss does a lot of things that will cause some people's eyebrows to shoot up, but you have to remember she has to survive. Even though she does some things that seem not totally right you know her heart is more or less in the right place. She is 16 (an aged used a lot in young adult novels I'm noticing)and still figuring out her stand on the important things. The whole thing is kind of disturbing, but you can see the appeal it would have on audiences. I mean I got sucked into it so it isn't really that far fetched that people could actually become well... so morbid. It's really hard for me to really get into what I want to discuss without giving away spoilers. I can say this though, the book had almost everything in it. Thrills, chills, suspense, humor (only a little but it's there), romance (kind of questionable I guess), struggle with identity, life and death situation (obviously), compassion and so much more that I'm sure I am missing. The world Collins created is extremely believable, and the dilemmas that are presented are engaging and sometimes just painful to watch, but she pulls this off with ease. People just have to read the book themselves to comprehend what I'm trying to say. Needless to say I am agonizing over the wait for the next installment Catching Fire.Later added: For those of you who didn't know there is a movie coming out!

The book appeals to those who enter a book through different doors. The PLOT door is exceptional - page turning action which is physical, emotional, and psychological. There is one plot twist after another. Boys will especially love this. The CHARACTER door, which may appeal more to girls, is also strong. The idea of survival versus relationships provides much food for thought. We get to know the characters well, and we invest in them. There is appeal in the SETTING and LANGUAGE doors as well.

"9780439023481","18974711","Darth J","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18974711-darth-j","September 2015 Updated ReviewI had initially put off reading the Hunger Games for years because:1. Dystopian fiction gets on my nerves.2. People were declaring it “the next Twilight”. *cringe*3. The description talked of poverty and politics, which made me suspect that the book would be a lecture on the author’s political views.All of the above reasons get an automatic “Nope” from me. I saw the movie though and thought it was alright, it didn’t seem to be the spectacle that everyone else described as “ahmazing”. I’ll admit that the trailer for Catching Fire did pique my interest enough to give the books a try. Well that, and the social prodding.So I read it, and it wasn’t as God awful as some other YA books out there in the same genre. I mean, seriously, have you read some of that other stuff? It’s terrible! Add dystopia to the mix and it sells like hotcakes - and still annoys the [expletive deleted] out of me. Which brings me to my first point: the dystopia presented in the Hunger Games is somewhat believable. Yes, it is a social commentary about the current financial crises in America today blah blah blah, but at least it isn’t some “outbreak that kills most of the population” [expletive deleted] story that other authors are peddling out at the moment. Secondly, I’m glad the “love story” takes a backseat. Katniss is actually a heroine who has balls. She isn’t the tough-as-nails female protagonist archetype that other “girl power” novelists love to create, but neither is she a Mary Sue. Her strength and determination come from desperation, from having been thrust into the role of the provider for her family and then trying to survive the barbarian Hunger Games. She questions Peeta’s motives like a smart girl should instead of being caught up in a whirlwind romance that presents itself. Thirdly, I’m glad this didn’t turn out to be a “and all this mess happened because we elected [insert name of real life despised candidate] for president” kind of book. When a storyteller does that it just makes me lose respect for them when they infuse their own radical political beliefs into a story in order to scare people to vote their own way. The Hunger Games didn’t. On other notes, how can a foodie like myself read a book called the ""Hunger Games"" and NOT comment on the food? MMM, goat cheese and apple slices on a roll… Lamb stew with plums – DAFUQ? No, just no. To put fruit with meat just seems like it goes against nature.

"9780439023481","5749698","Kat (Lost in Neverland)","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5749698-kat-lost-in-neverland","Review Rewritten Due to Excessive Use of Exclamation Points and Caps Lock. And General Horrible Bad Reviewness. Seriously, I wrote this over two years ago and it sucked.It still does.1.5 Stars The Concept: A lot of people don't like the book because of the concept of kids killing each other in a big arena. When I first heard of the book, I actually thought this was a pretty cool dystopian idea. (Not in real life, but in a dystopic world) A few months after I had read the book, I heard of this new thing; Battle Royale. It's a Japanese book that was published WAY before The Hunger Games and basically has the exact same concept. So, obviously, many people are blaming Suzanne Collins for copying BR. I for one, haven't seen the movie or read the book, but maybe once I've read it, I can make a better assumption. The Characters: Truthfully, I felt the characters were pretty bland. I didn't like Katniss. She was a robot for most of the book, and I couldn't connect with her at all. She also hated the cat Prim had. I get it; you didn't want an extra mouth to feed...but did you have to go and try to drown it?! Your NAME is 'Kat'. Dude.The Fighting: Tons. But the actual Hunger Games don't start until halfway through the book! Bloody, gory, some falling off hands here, spears plunged into stomachs, boys reduced to a 'bloody hunk of meat', all that glorious chiz. Honestly, I really don't mind bloody/violent stuff. In fact, I love it! But everything else with the book was awful. The Romance: When someone recommended or mentioned this book to me, they usually used the word 'romance' or 'dystopic-romance'. So, you know, I was expecting some romance. I got nothing.Usually, I hate when romance interrupts a book and it irritates the crap out of me when there is unnecessary romance in a book. In this case, I was glad there wasn't much, but throughout the novel, I was so utterly confused. The constant question was always in my mind; ""Were they in love, or are they just acting for the audience? Gah! Make up your mind!""The whole 'romance' crap felt extremely forced and awkward. The Writing and How it Made you Want to Read More: The writing itself wasn't actually that good. It was very simple and any seventh grader could write it. Maybe that's why it's so popular. It was extremely addicting. I couldn't put it down even though sometimes I wanted to. Like in the middle of the night, when I really needed to go to bed, I couldn't stop reading and then....my favorite character died. Um, how exactly am I supposed to go to sleep now? The Ending: Creepiest. Ending. Ever. The mutt/werewolves/mutants things were SO FREAKING SCARY. And the creepiest thing was that each one had a collar around its neck with either a 1,2,3,4,5, etc. as the 12 districts. And they resembled the tributes, as in a russet werewolf was a red-headed girl, a black wolf with green eyes was a black-haired boy with green eyes, etc. They're genetically mutated werewolves that were made to look like the contestants and they may or not have the contenders DNA in them....*gag*Not to mention that they tortured this one boy until he was reduced to a 'bloody chunk of meat in a pool of blood' Yeah, that was actually the author's wording! I was literally sick to my stomach after I finished the book.The thing is, I was really enjoying the book...for about halfway through. When they got to the 'wasps' and Katniss started hallucinating, that's when the novel started going downhill for me. That downhill became very, very steep, until my opinion of it was flying down like a sled on slick, icy snow. By the very end, it hit the bottom with a disgusted, angry splat.So if you like any of the following: Lots of blood, fake/'I don't know if I like him or like like him or not' romance, intense violence, and genetically mutated werewolves, this book is for you! I watched the movie and guess what? I really liked it. I couldn't believe it at first either. I loved the Capital, the characters, the arena, everything! Even the Muttations were okay in the end. And you know what? MY MOM LIKED IT TOO. And my dad, but that's besides the point. My mother was dreading this movie. When we got it, she said; ""Aw, do we have to watch that? You said you hated the book!""Me: ""Yeah, but I wanted to see if the movie is better.""She didn't get that. But she watched it anyway and she really enjoyed it. Damn. I even thought the romance was cute. OH MY GOD, WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH KAT.","Jul 29, 2011"

It is written in the voice of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives in the future, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America. The Capitol, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12–18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death.Characters: Katniss Everdeen, Peeta Mellark, Cato, Primrose Everdeen, Gale Hawthorne, Effie Trinket, Haymitch Abernathy, Cinna, President Coriolanus Snow, Rue, Octavia, Venia, Flavius, Avox girl, Marvel, Glimmer, Clove, Foxface, Thresh, Greasy Sae, Madge Undersee, Portia, Caesar Flickerman, Claudius Templesmithعنوانها: عطش مبارزه؛ اثر: سوزان کالینز؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش: پنجم ماه آوریل سال 2014 میلادیعنوان: عطش مبارزه - جلد نخست از سه گانه عطش مبارزه؛ اثر: سوزان کالینز؛ برگردان: شبنم سعادت؛ تهران، نشر افزار، 1389، در 408 ص، شابک: 9789642433179 ؛ چاپ دوم 1392؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان انگلیسی - قرن 21 منخستین کتاب از سه‌ گانه ی «عطش مبارزه» به شمار است و ماجرای دختری شانزده ساله است به نام «کتنیس اِوِردین»؛ که در «مسابقات عطش مبارزه» رقابت‌هایی که بین بیست و چهار نفر (12 پسر و 12 دختر دوازده تا 18 ساله)؛ هر سال به صورت رویدادی زنده از تلویزیون در مناطق دوازده گانه کشور «پانم» پخش می‌شود. در مسابقات یک پسر و یک دختر را از هر دوازده ناحیه؛ با قید قرعه انتخاب میکنند؛ و آنها پس از نبرد با یکدیگر تا پای جان، تاب میاورند، در پایان مسابقه، تنها یک تن باید زنده بماند، و برنده اعلام شود؛ اما ...؛تصویر روی جلد: پرنده و تیری محاط در حلقه‌ ای طلایی رنگ با پس زمینه‌ ای سیاه است. همان سنجاق سینه‌ ای ست که «مج»، دختر شهردار و دوست «کتنیس» به وی هدیه داده، در کتاب از زبان «کتنیس» می‌خوانیم: گویی یک نفر پرنده‌ ی کوچک طلایی رنگی را ساخته، و سپس آن را به حلقه‌ ای که دور آن است وصل کرده؛ تنها نوک بال‌های پرنده به حلقه متصل است. ناگهان آن را می‌شناسم، یک زاغ مقلد است. پایان نقلا. شربیانی","Nov 13, 2012"

I knew what it was about pretty much since its publication, but always avoided to read it because of the ridiculous hype it received. Suzanne Collins has influenced an entire genre with her trilogy, inspiring popular series like Divergent or Legend, which can be considered an achievement to be admired for. The opinion that this series is way over-hyped still hasn't left my mind, but by now, I can finally see why this book is so beloved by readers all over the world. Easy to get into, easy to read, not too complex, yet fast-paced and cleverly plotted with characters you can easily get attached to - that's what defines The Hunger Games, in my opinion. Some of its qualities can be considered negative in a literary context, but for me it also became a book which it was impossible to take down after a certain amount of pages, and even inspite of its clearly present flaws, Suzanne Collins managed to create an engaging adventure story in a dystopian setting.The adventure aspect in this book was the most intriguing. I didn't know about most of the plot points before reading it, so the book continued to surprise me with every chapter. Fast-paced as it was, boredom never managed to overtake the excitement of learning what was to come next, as well as the interior urge to learn what happened in the past to divide the districts in such a way. Unfortunately, a historical background to previous events in the novel's timeline which lead to the way Panem is structured in this story was the last thing Suzanne Collins thought about to give her readers, but I still don't lose hope that we get a more insightful exploration of this topic in the following sequels. Also, it's difficult to believe the explanation for the introduction of the Hunger Games as a method to keep citizens from organizing another uprising against the powerful government. Some plot points felt forced, as if Collins needed to take the plot in a certain direction and sacrificed her characters for the sake of the plot, but ultimately, she managed to create a balanced story with both engaging plotlines and interesting characters.The novel cannot be praised for its originality; in fact, a lot of people have already pointed out before how similar it is to the earlier published Japanese Battle Royale, but reading it for what it is, that fact doesn't take the excitement away from the novel. I practically inhaled the last 200 pages in the course of a few hours, always wanting to know what was to happen next, and the portrayal of Katniss Everdeen as the female protagonist helped a lot with this: Katniss is strong, cunning, she doesn't mind what others think of her, and she doesn't hesitate to use certain events to her own benefit, even if it means manipulating others. A lot of other authors have since then tried to come up with more characters like Katniss, but most of them feel like bad copies (yes, I am totally referring to Divergent's Tris). In addition, the reality television aspect was an outstanding part of the novel which I particularly enjoyed. It seemed like a very believable and realistic addition to the story.Ultimately, even if there are things you can criticize about The Hunger Games, those aspects never became strong enough to disrupt my enjoyment of the excitement that was this book. I am definitely going to read the sequel, even though I'll wait some time in order to escape my usual antipathy against second books in a series. I don't exactly regret never having read it earlier, but it is also a good feeling to have read it now and to finally know the reasons for the hype it received.","Nov 12, 2015"

Thanks.8 Things I liked + 1 I didn't + 1 I hated8. It's cinematic. -- I don't know if I'd have appreciated this if I hadn't read The Hunger Games in anticipation of the film's release, but the March 23rd premiere precipitated my read, and I could see the action of this book on my ""head screen."" It's going to work as a movie, and Collins' successfully tranferred the action she saw moving in her mind to the page. She made me see it too, and I am now officially stoked to see the film of her tale.7. First person. -- I was not impressed with the first person perspective in the first chapter, but by the time Katniss was moving through the arena I understood how right that perspective was. It ramped up the suspence, and it's going to make for an easier transition to the big screen. 6. The Capitol and Districts. -- Plenty of real world, contemporary issues to be found in the structure of Panem. Plenty of room for criticism. Plenty of bile directed at the haves and honouring of the have-nots (now haves?). It may be worth adding this to a first year reading list, but I worry that things fall apart as the series progresses. Which reminds me of the question I had throughout ... ""does this really need to be a series?"" It feels like one book should be enough. 5. Nostalgia. -- I remember an old Sci-Fi paperback from my Junior High library with one of those pulpy covers. There was some hilltop with a a black sky gate opening above, and for some reason I remember a bunch of kids doing combat on some planet. I wish I could remember something more about the book, but every page of The Hunger Games took me back to the halls of Don Bosco and that book cover keeps flashing in front of my eyes. I love it when shit like that happens.4. Dystopia. -- I love dystopian books, and as dystopias go this is one of the most normal -- which ramps up the creepiness for me. I pretty much live in District 11 at the moment, and I can see us heading down the road to our own Hunger Games a generation or two from now. There's some compelling immediacy here for me. 3. Mockingjays and Tracker Jackers  -- These were some of the best future tech innovations I've ever read. Their backstories made sense, they were well integrated into the tale, they were used subtly, and they added just the right amount of verisimilitude. They were well struck notes, and I will remember them both forever (unless the film fucks them up). 2. Katniss Everdeen. -- I believed in her as a character. She rang true, sure and true (sorry, I'm listening to Albert Hammond), and I can overlook all kinds of crap when I love a character as much as I love Katniss. Her choices made sense to the woman she is; her skills were within reason; I believed her loves and hates; and her conflicts worked. She's the only reason I'd be compelled to read on (well, I would read on also if the movie was good enough to drive me to the sequel).1. It's compelling. -- I stayed up until the wee hours to read this. I don't do that on purpose anymore. I may keep reading when my insomnia kicks in to keep myself sane, but to actually risk messing up my sleep schedule to finish a book is a rarity. But I needed to finish. And it was mostly worth it. 1. It's sheaf, Suzanne. -- It's not a ""sheath"" of arrows. It's a sheaf. I thought it was a typo the first time, then it was repeated throughout. Piss poor editing, and an annoying mistake that really could have been avoided.1. Wolfie Muttations. -- I see no defensible purpose for this bizarre twist. I saw it coming, was begging Collins not to do it, and was left deflated by its happening. Mercifully it ended quickly and we were back on track, but this was a cheap piece of manipulation that really took away from the story for me. I didn't need any more reason to think that Panem and its Capitol were fucked. This was Collins' one bad choice. Overdetermine much?","Sep 09, 2009"

For my first time in English, I'm pleasantly surprised by the writing : I hear you I hear you, it's not the better book ever written by far, but that's not what I expected. While quite simple, it stays to the point, and in my opinion perfect to convey the sense of urgency the Games create. Seven years later, I still think that many authors could learn a lot from this novel. 1) First to not let the story revolve around eight-packs and smirks. PLEASE DO THAT. 2) Then to create a world-building that actually makes sense with believable threats : do I think that people would love watching teenagers fighting to death? Sadly, yes, I do, and I have History on my side (Rome, anyone?). Feel free to disagree with the pessimistic sides of me on this. Nobody wants to hear about a world where the reasons behind the oppression are never explained, yet unfortunately too many dystopian out there introduce the WHAT without never getting to the WHY and sometimes barely the HOW. Some issues are left unanswered at the end of this first book, but overall I think that it's pretty consistant for a YA dystopian. 3) Finally (because I want to keep my review to a minimum), to picture a female lead who is strong but relatable, who focuses on her goals but is also able to care for others - yet not for everyone, which is great, because it wouldn't be believable now would it?(view spoiler)[Also, other dystopians don't have a Peeta who doesn't know how to walk quietly. *HUGE SMILE* (hide spoiler)]► For all these reasons, even though The Hunger Games aren't flawless, they deserve all the stars in my book.

I did not see that coming. Which is why I put off reading this series as much as I could. At one point I was sure I would never read it.But let me start at the beginning. I saw the movie first. It was advertised as Twilight for smart people. I was in my Twilight phase, so I found that offensive as there were no vampires in The Hunger Games. Not to mention the shock and the repulsion at the plot (At that point in my life I had no idea what dystopia meant. I was all into adult and/or vampire literature.). And I found the actress playing Katniss quite bad. She mostly had only one expression on her face for the entire movie (just as the boy playing Harry Potter). Little did I know that it was something the character wanted, not showing any emotion. And that's why a book is so much better than a movie. You get more information.Then I became active on GR and The Hunger Games was all I saw when comparing books with other people. I resisted reading it for more than a year, then I said I'd give it a try. If I liked it then fine, if I didn't then I'd dnf. But I liked it. Big time.I love both Katniss and Peeta. And I love how for quite a part of the book Katniss is on her own, and it isn't boring. I was there in the wood with her all the way, almost feeling cold at night and smelling the pine trees. I thank Suzanne Collins for that. There aren't many YA authors who can make me forget I'm reading about teenagers. Actually, I'd say this is closer to adult than YA. There isn't any unnecessary teenage angst. These kids understand the graveness and horror of the situation they're in, and they do their best to try and survive. I wish I'd see more of that in YA books.And Peeta. In the movie it felt as if he intruded on Katniss and Gale. In the book it's a whole other story. Katniss sees Gale as more of a friend than anything else. She's not secretly in love with the handsome, popular guy. And I think the book-Peeta is better looking than the movie-Peeta. Also, even if he is in love with Katniss, he doesn't seem as desperate as he does in the movie. Truth be told, I saw the movie again yesterday and it felt like seeing it for the first time. All the characters had more depth than the first time.Not to mention that twist at the end with the mutts. That wasn't in the movie, and it was so cruel. What kind of people would do that?Now, if you'll excuse me, I really, really need to continue with the second book. I have a few arcs waiting for me, but I cannot think of anything else.","Oct 15, 2016"

(But only somewhat.)The writing is… absolutely horrid. I did not know that since I left that idyll & phantasmagoric kingdom penned graciously by maestro R. L. Stein nothing with the exception of the Potter books has been added to the canon for the benefit of modernday intellectually-growing young adults. The...shame...!So, first off, anyone interested in GOOD dystopian lit should immediately go to Margaret Atwood's fantastic MaddAddam Trilogy (""Oryx and Crake"", ""The Year of the Flood""...) for an actually experience, not a half-assed, half-baked panoramic half-world, but a wondrous, fully-alive universe which holds in store ""muttations"" far more terrifying than Collins's. If you want romance on that scale of lametude, check out the ""Twilight"" saga…!Now, that being the worst of it (it may be a deal breaker for some folks) the novel is rife with ideas, (ideas and concepts such as revolution, causes for catastrophe, skills for survival, mass media coverups, etc.) most of which have been previously encountered in other YA novels, like the aforementioned boy wizard ones.

There have indeed been works published that are more badly written than this one, but, keep in mind that this book is even being used in schools, and I very much doubt that the self-published novels mentioned would ever attain that status (Well, I certainly hope not, the day that happens, I think I shall buy a bottle of gin and get very, very drunk.) Oh, er... apologies to the court. *bows*My first contention is that the author used a very clumsy style. I've consulted the advice of some authors/teachers giving advice regarding creative writing, and this is what they have to say:"" ""He said"" and ""she said"" - this type of attributives, when used with expressive dialog that speaks for itself, may be unnecessary, especially if there is other action text which makes it clear who is speaking. From a piece of advice elsewhere: "" When two characters are speaking, attributives are only necessary for the characters' first appearances.“That’s an attractive hammer,” he said.“A family heirloom,” she said.“I never would have guessed.”“You don’t look like the guessing type.”The reader will keep track of “he said” and “she said” after the preliminary exchange. Further attributives will slow down what promises to be an interesting conversation. ""I will grant VR this, that at least MS Collins didn't make the mistakes we saw in some of the other novels mentioned in evidence submitted above, such as :  Many writers try to think for the reader by replacing “said” with words like grunted, growled, demanded, bellowed, cooed, roared, squalled, and simpered. If the tone of the dialogue is not immediately apparent, rewrite the dialogue and not the attributive.This goes double for adding adverbs like belligerently, arrogantly, haughtily, angrily, coquettishly, happily, slavishly, and jokingly. I supose a lucky happenstance and by-product of the 1st person present tense being used, is that it's going to sound REALLY clumsy when you say:"" Remember, I tell myself [bracingly/bravely/quietly/cleverly/merrily/huskily]. You’re the hunter now, not them. ""..so at least there is not too much of that in THG.However, Ms Collins doesn't see the superfluity of dispensing with ""I see"" I guess"" ""I hear"" ""I imagine"" ""I feel"" ""I decide"" ""I spot"" ""I detect"" ""I think"" ""I perceive"" ""I judge"" etc.Examples:  "" I don’t see any other tributes, but I do notice some of the things Rue has mentioned. """"It’s not yet dawn, but my stinging eyes can see it."" ..but for me the worst offender was ""I think.""This is 1st person present tense, so it should be quite obvious that she is thinking, correct? This is part of what makes the point of view so awkward. How is it that one is looking in on somebody's thought processes? ... it becomes even stranger if the narrator keeps reminding you that she is ""thinking"".Examples:  This is an okay place to die, I think. My fingertips make small swirling patterns in the cool, slippery earth. I love mud, I think. That’s mine, I think. It’s meant for me.It’s the smoke, I think. It’s sedated them. It’s now or never, I think, and begin to saw. Better, I think, to sneak up here at dawn and send the nest into my enemies.Each time I wake, I think, At last, this is over, but it isn’t.And suddenly, I’m not thinking of Gale but of Peeta and . . . Peeta! He saved my life! I think. Water first, I think. You can hunt along the way now.I’d better get out of here, I think. They’ll be making a beeline for he place. But once I’m on my feet, I realize escape may not be so easy.Let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin, Cato, I think. Let them begin for real.Sing? I think. Sing what?It’s old, very old I think. Six of us left, I think. Where are you, Cato? I think etc. etc. etc...and of course the perpetual : he said, she said.However, your honor and members of the jury, I personally wish that 1st person present tense would be shot at dawn. *Cough* er.. I request that remark to be disregarded for the official record.Basically, I found this long-winded, uneconomical narrative so booorring and pedestrian, that I had to keep whipping myself to stay with it. The only reason I managed to push through to the end, is because I wanted to see what all the hype was about. This plot could have been delivered much more efficiently in about 2/3 of the amount of words that it took Collins to get there.Secondly, I would like to point out some features of the plot. The ""kids killing kids "" aspect has been so obviously ripped off from Battle Royale, that it doesn't even require demonstration. The fact is obvious. However, a little problem or two creeps in with the setting.We find ourselves in a future America where a central regime has subjugated the rest of America and somehow managed to divide commerce and industry up into  geographical areas as follows, per 'district' (District 1 does luxury items, District 4 does fishing, etc.):1. Luxury Items2. Unknown3. Factories4. Fishing, anything sea-related.5. Unknown6. Unknown7. Trees, AKA lumber and etc.8. Textiles (clothing)9. Generates electricity10. Raises livestock & cattle for eating11. Agriculture12. Coal Mining13. Graphite/Nuclear Weapons...so.. each area of the US is now divided into a geographical area that supports only one industry; most of which are known, but some are not, as demonstrated in my list. Well... -agriculture - only one single area? ... and livestock makes up one of 12 equally divided up districts ? ""Oh my!"" as Ana Steele would have said. *Ms Trav points to a map showing the current distribution of agriculture in the United States of America.*http://go.grolier.com/map?id=mtlr050&...To utter another Ana Steele-ism: ""Oh crap"". It would appear as if Ms Collins bunked some of her Geography lessons...*chuckles* Also, the fishing district must be one pretty loonng, thin area, I'm thinking.Also, one wonders which one of the blue areas on this map would be District 11? *points to* http://www1.eere.energy.gov/manufactu.....and Ooooohhh, Myyy, I guess a lot of factories went defunct after Panem became the capital... http://www.brookings.edu/research/int...Well. So, somewhere in the middle of that map, is an area where nobody does absolutely anything, except watch television all day long, and strut about wearing weird make-up. Excepting for their amaaa-zingly technologically advanced military force, of course. This military exists for the main reason of keeping the 'districts' subjugated. [image error] They keep themselves busy by tracking down escapee kids and cutting their tongues out. I can quite get the point that VR makes when they see metaphors for the super-rich in Panem, and social classes and industries in the populace of the 'districts', but this councilor has a hard time envisaging exactly how the logistics of dividing these demographic strata into separate geographical areas would be managed.However, Your Honor, I think we are running out of time, since there are really a whole bunch of much better books that I'd like to get to reading; so I would like to move on to the second charge, if we may.HHJGR: Certainly. Councillors VR?VR: We would like to put forward various reasons why we think Ms Trav's claims fail.One of our arguments: [argument 1] I think the book is a condemnation of killing and violence. Katniss openly acknowledges that the games are specifically designed to humiliate the public by forcing them to contribute their young into what is entirely pointless bloodbath, where the tributes are FORCED to kill one another. She openly discusses the reluctance with which she enters these games, and her horror at the 'careers' who actually do relish in the killing that occurs. If anything, the story is a condemnation of callous killing and violence. Collin's use of Katniss as the narrator, and her ambivalence towards people and emotions in general, is a critique on our modern society's desensitization to violence for entertainment purposes. Point being - being 'prepared to kill' is extremely different than wanting to kill. Peeta doesn't seem like he wants to kill anyone either.. he does feel remorse at the unintentional killing of Foxface by the berries. Katniss is just a teenage girl, and is forced to be prepared to kill to survive - that is in itself a critique of the society they live in. That doesn't glamorize violence, Katniss would not be in that situation if she didn't have to be.Another popular argument amongst many of our female proponents, [argument 2]is that Katniss is so kickass, that we should actually applaud her savagery because at least she's not portraying the despised stereotype of a helpless, passive, submissive female.A third argument, [argument 3] is: And while this place can be found within the pages of Suzanne Collins' brilliant dystopian young-adult fantasy novel, The Hunger Games, where it is called Panem - a nation that rose from the ashes of a future North America - it can also be found in the pages of the annual Human Rights Watch World Report. It can be found around the corner, and around the globe, right here and now, in this ""real"" world in which we live. And that, of course, is the brilliance of Collins' work, and of this genre. Dystopian fiction - the best of it, anyway - doesn't just offer us a cautionary tale, a portrait of what could be. No, it also offers us a mirror, a glimpse of ourselves, as we are now. It may be that this mirror distorts, and that we see but darkly. But for every distortion, for every detail of the real world that is occluded or transformed, some deeper truth is revealed. In the real world, there isn't one wealthy Capitol, and twelve impoverished Districts. But there are areas of vast affluence and influence, whose inhabitants experience a plenty unimaginable to many of their fellow human beings. In the real world, we don't hold gladiatorial games in which children (known as ""tributes""), ranging in age from twelve to eighteen, are forced to battle one another to the death, as a form of demoralizing punishment for their elders. But we do use hundreds of thousands of children as soldiers, arming and often drugging them, using them as tools - both practical and psychological - in adult conflicts. (See the website of The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers for more information on this most pernicious form of child abuse).*VR submits the following document regarding argument 3 above*: http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...VR: That is all we have time for, in the space given, I am afraid.HHJGR: Ms Trav?Ms Trav: Thank you, your Honor.We shall start by addressing the arguments one and three together. In deference to argument 3, we have read the Human Rights Watch World report for 2009, which seems to be the latest published report we could find.4 of the main English speaking parts of the world, Britain, (and this councilor would personally disagree with such an omission - though irrelevant for purposes of this court case) new Zealand, Australia and Canada were not even included in the report. The US was included, for the death penalty, for detentions and circumstances pertaining thereto, and issues regarding refugees and ""unrecognized citizens"".Nothing in there about using child soldiers, but there is a separate report published about using child labor on farms. Oh really. This councillor's heart bleeds for children who are made to work a little (while still attending school), instead of becoming helpless, rude, molly-coddled brats. Also for children who lie about their age. That sound too conservative for you? Well, guess what, this councillor never thought that a bit of work hurt anybody. However, she does agree that there should be an age limit of at least 12 years old (with very restricted hours - no more than 14 hours a week at such young ages). ..so, while agreeing that better monitoring should be instituted in this area, keep in mind that this is purely agricultural work (strictly no manufacturing) like seasonal veggie and fruit picking we are talking about here. Having your child help out during harvest time isn't the worst idea in the world. I made my kids help me in the garden at age 6 and they loved it! (So shoot me for having my kids do some weeding and helping to pack a pebble garden) .  I think it's character building, not to mention fun, so I don't quite see what is so terrible about the practice, as long as it's practiced in moderation and doesn't affect school work in any way. .. the point is that the above, in no way correlates to being forced to kill other children at ages as young as 12 years old - let alone humans of any age forced to kill innocent civilians in a non-war zone!This councilor also read the report on child soldiers. No child soldiers amongst the main audience who would be reading this book, in the countries mentioned above, if you count ""children"" as being younger than 16y 6m.In the US, Australia, Britain, and Canada, although being allowed to enlist at younger ages, no persons are allowed to serve on active duty until reaching age 18.Most of the countries where children under the age of 18 are allowed to take part in active fighting, are situated in the African and Arab world; and some in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe, but none of the people who make them fight could qualify as a real-world equivalent of the opulent, leisured, consumerist and entertainment oriented class of people depicted by THG's Panem.So I fail to see the relevance of the intended target audience for this novel to the countries employing child soldiers, who all fall outside of the ambit of both this books' intended readership, as well as the geographical areas or societies depicted within the novel. So, as for argument 3, I simply fail to see the connection . Sorry. VR are welcome to point out the connection more clearly, but they would certainly need to submit more evidence, in this councilor's opinion.Now, regarding argument 1, and this councillor's accusation that this book is inappropriately targeted towards children as young as 9 (who are reading it in droves) to fully appreciate the moral implications of the material.It's as simple as this: Katniss is depicted as a glamorous, sexy, kick-ass character whom girls and boys could identify with. (Do a little test, imagine that Katniss is a boy and Peeta is a girl. See how it could still work? )...and even if you keep Peeta a boy, boys could still identify with him, since he is portrayed just positively enough to make him a character possible to identify with: he is street-smart, physically strong, and socially savvy. So, despite all of Katniss's infuriating social bluntness and her lack of social skills, Peeta is her foil, and together they make a sparkly couple. Only, they have zero moral backbone (in the first book at least) - they simply go along with the whole routine of falling in with the faceless oppressors who want to be entertained by seeing them kill innocent children, some as young as 12 years old. Sure,(view spoiler)[ Peeta does have enough backbone to resist killing Katniss, but the events make it clear that the sole reason for this is because he is in love with Katniss. The fact that he had absolutely y zero compunction in killing the girl who started the fire, is a clear indication of this.  (hide spoiler)] (This part was wisely excised out of the film, where neither Peeta nor Katniss directly  kill anybody.)Now, me, if someone forced me to kill at least one innocent child, even while they were holding a gun to my head, I would say: ""Go ahead, shoot."" Really? Really. Why? Well, because if they didn't shoot me before I did such a heinous thing, I would certainly shoot myself after doing such a heinous thing, simply because I wouldn't be able to live with myself after doing this - I would despise myself too much. Do I know this for a fact? Yes, I know this for a fact. Therefore, I'd much rather show the middle finger by saying ""NO!"" to such and act, and let them shoot me, than to actually align myself with such douchebags and go through with such an act merely for their entertainment ...I just couldn't live with myself if I did that.VR: OBJECTION!HHJGR: VR?VR: In the following novels they DO object and rebel! ..and like we said before, Katniss and Peeta both say they don't like the idea...Ms Trav: Your Honor, it may be the case that they rebel in later novels, but we are currently reviewing this novel. This councillor would be happy to rate the later novels based on their own merit.HHJGR: Objection denied, regarding the later novels. Ms Trav, what is your rebuttal of the second part of the objection?NOTE: Goodreads seems to limit the length of a review and I have run out of space, so this review is continued in the comments section below.

That delightfully precocious pixie of a full-grown girl who may not be the beauty of the world, but whose offbeat charm has vaulted her into the goddess stratosphere is missing and that's a crying shame.""Pretty"" is always nice, but give me the goofy girl every time!Okay, let's move on from that barely-serious diatribe...All the hoopla surrounding The Hunger Games had me expecting a reading experience so enthralling that it would whip my nipples off. Well, I've still got me nips. So, was this exciting at all? Yes. As exciting as the build up made it out to be? No, of course not. Is it ever? By now I should know better than to get too excited about reading a book said to be OMG!!!-good.However, relative to other books, The Hunger Games had maybe a few more moments that kept me chained to it and reading on when I might have stopped, but in no way did I get irretrievably wrapped up in it. And that's probably because the story of a young girl fighting for her life and falling in love wasn't written with me in mind. Its appeal is not intended for a middle-aged grump. This is a YA novel. I had to keep reminding myself of that and excuse its immature voice and some of the writing...although describing inanimate objects as being ""heartless"" gave me a chuckle, while the somewhat common use of adverb shortcuts couldn't help but annoy. I can see why The Hunger Games has become popular with teens. It's a coming of age tale in which the revelation that the real world and the people in it are not always black and white, good and evil, dawns upon the main character as it eventually does for teens.Word of warning. I listened to the audiobook version of this as narrated by veteran television actress Carolyn McCormick. You may have seen her on Law and Order or One Life To Live. If you ever come across a book narrated by her, avoid it like the muthafncking plague! McCormick laid on the melodrama thick, stressing the last word in what seemed like every sentence. Go back to the start of this paragraph and lay on a heavy dose of languishing drama and epic intensity to the last word in each sentence and you can see how hit or miss the technique (if you can call that technique) works and how utterly annoying it is. It made me shout ""Your speech pattern sucks!"" for the first time in my life. Not to beat down on the woman, but she also has a baby-talk lisp that comes out when she pronounces ""s"", ""th"" and ""oo"" sounds. Listening to her pronounce ""juice"" is pretty funny. Listening to her for nine hours is not. NOTE: I made sure to separate my negative feelings over the audiobook narration from my feelings on the book itself and my 3-star rating reflects that.","Aug 29, 2011"
"9780439023481","193310","brian","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/193310-brian","on the one hand, the hunger games fits my idea of what 'story' meant back when i was a kid, transporting me to #6 school library c. 1986, where mrs. greene would read aloud and i'd go all outerbody, floating off to the ineffable realm of 'lost in a book' world. over the two days i read this thing, i had that slight bookbuzz between reading sessions (better than any booze or drug i know) and 'fess up to sneaking pages in at any and all available intervals (at the coffeemachine, on the shitter, walking the hound, etc)... on the other hand, i found it a book of incredible wasted opportunities. my problems?here are a few: after such a bold move as taking her sister's place in the hunger games, katniss doesn't really have all that much to do. she dodges a few magic bullets (i'll get into that later), and makes out with a baker's son, but she never really has to do anything she doesn't want to do (or, perhaps, anything that could potentially damage her standing (read: sales) with the book's core bookbuying demographic) -- this thing never lives up to the expectations collins herself has set, and katniss rarely has a moment of introspection or reaction. (is a spoiler alert necessary? has anyone not already read this book?) who does katniss kill? 1) a boy who just murdered 12 yr old rue. 2) cato, while he's being slowly tortured to death. the first is easy. wildly justified and never given a second thought. (literally. even if the murder is 100% justified, it's gotta impact any non-sociopath, right? could collins have spared a single page to either a nice existenzy moment in which katniss became acutely aware that she took away 'all he has... all he's ever gonna have.*' or, at least, a kind of natural revulsion at the sheer physicality of plunging a knife through flesh and bone?) and the second is a mercy killing, an act of kindness and bravery. why create this 'battle royale' scenario only to breeze over the most challenging part? why not dig a bit deeper into katniss's character, get a bit into 'the horror, the horror'? there seemed a deliberate attempt to keep things a bit surfacey and transfer all the 'deep' stuff onto a somewhat manufactured love triangle. and as for those magic bullets. i suppose it's possible to run blindfolded across a busy five-lane highway and avoid getting clipped, but... it's very unlikely. and dramatically, it's stupid. it becomes comedy. it's bowfinger. if you're gonna toss katniss into this world, milk it. goose your reader. push it to the brink, lady. you took the easy way out on the 'big' issues, why take the easy way out with your set pieces? lemme examine a single scene to make my point -- the penultimate action scene in which katniss rushes out into the opening to get the medicine. here's what happens: 1. a knife whisks through the air and slices her forehead. now, katniss didn't see it coming, didn't dodge in the nick of time... it just happened to fly by so as to conveniently bloody up her forehead, but without instantly transforming her into a drooling vegetable. seriously lucky. down to the microsecond & micromeasurement lucky. but let's move on. seconds later: 2. katniss is pounced by some chick who holds her down and traces a knife over her lips. about to plunge the knife in, at the very last millisecond... she's thrown off! ok, another 'down to the micromeasurement' save in the same scene. and seconds later: 3. the guy who pulled the girl off is about to kill katniss, but, again - at the last second! - when he learns she was good to rue, he lets her go. what?!?! really?!?! this late in the game? knowing it's kill or be killed? he lets her go? b/c she was sweet to a girl that he would've had to kill, anyway? sorry. maybe any of these elements on their own would be fine, but three of 'em in a single scene? (a knife that is microseconds from its mark followed by a killer who is microseconds from her mark followed by a killer who has a 'at the last microsecond' change of heart)... when nearly every set piece plays out like this, i gotta say one thing to miss collins: diminishing returns! diminishing fucking returns! and puh-leeze don't take refuge in the argument that it's a YA book. now, look. with YA there are wider parameters (you can, for example, be a bit more derivative in that your audience is reading this shit for the first time), but why soften your edges? why create great Hitchcockian scenes of suspense and breadcrumbs only to have them lead up to Bayesque (michael, that is) setpieces of luck, chance, magic bullets, and serious muddafuckin' boooshit?! and why downplay the psychological and/or moral effects of murder? i don't get it.collins seemed almost to have a checklist in terms of catchy story elements and ways to catch hold of the zeitgeist. which is not a disparagement. she's a great storyteller with a knack for making said story applicable to the contemporary human dilemma (society of the spectacle, fascism vs. liberty, etc) -- and, it's terrific that kids are reading books about a tough, no-nonsense chick who has a kind of political awakening...but collins, in this first volume, was kinda lazy. which is a shame b/c she made something pretty special. *unforgiven","Mar 27, 2012"

What I'm really here to talk about is the movie, and this is going to have spoilers like you wouldn't believe. Just warning you.We just returned from watching the Hunger Games movie, and the experience was deeply disturbing. It should be disturbing, of course: we watched a movie about teenagers being forced to kill one another for the entertainment of a wealthy, lucky few. So, it's not disturbing that the movie itself was disturbing.What was REALLY disturbing, though, was the audience. As one teenager beat another one to death--a large male beating a small female--the audience burst into cheers because the girl was essentially a badguy. The girl was, at most, 13 or 14. The actress looked the appropriate age. The cheering didn't even stop when her small body was dropped into the grass and the camera focused in on her lifeless face. We're sitting in a huge theater, watching a film where 24 children are required to fight to the death against one another. There is a mild amount of romance mixed in with all of the carnage, and the kiss between Peeta and Katniss was enough to get a large part of the audience whistling and squeeling with delight. It was like they were watching an entirely different movie from the one Joy and I were watching.I remember reading some reviews of the book pointing out how many reviews focused entirely on the half-assed romance story, ENTIRELY MISSING THE POINT OF THE SERIES. It wasn't until seeing the audience reaction to the film that this really sunk in. Are these people entirely oblivious that THEY are the audience to the Hunger Games? Do they really not recognize the Capital is a slightly exaggerated version of us wealthy first-worlders? Granted, we don't take two tributes from each district. We tend to attack people outright, police their countries, and then replace their political structures with something more to our liking. But, a rose by any other name smells just as sweet. The book attempted to challenge our expectations, and the movie tried to as well. The violence constantly felt WRONG. Each death gave me the same queasy, emotional feeling I get when I watch The Lord of the Flies. Instead of casting the teenagers with a bunch of attractive twenty-somethings, they actually chose children, most of whom did not look ready for combat. They made a point of showing you children who were dead, but not giving you the twisted satisfaction of drawn-out and exciting fight scenes. This movie had much more brutality than action. And the scene with Cato breaking down at the end was almost perfect, although his death was more drawn out and difficult to stomach in the book.But it doesn't matter what Suzanne Collins writes, or what the director directs, if the audience is oblivious to anything challenging their world views. I suppose if you're looking hard enough for an 'action' movie, you can find one in The Hunger Games. And if you only care about which boy Katniss ends up with in the end, you might totally miss the fact that YOU'RE THE FUCKING CAPITAL, and BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO THE CAPITAL. We've decided to just rent the Hunger Games movies from here on out, because they're troubling enough without having to deal with the audience as well.","Jan 03, 2012"

"9780439023481","26681101","Markus","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26681101-markus","“May the odds be ever in your favor!”In the ruins of what was once North America, the cruel and tyrannic empire of Panem is preparing for the 74th annual Hunger Games, gladiatorial fights where youths from all twelve outlying districts are forced into killing each other in an arena, as punishment for a forgotten rebellion.There is something strangely compelling about the tale of Katniss Everdeen, a poor girl from the poorest of the twelve district, and her journey to the Capitol as a tribute for the Hunger Games. After volunteering for the games to save her younger sister, she embarks on a journey that will take her through the constant fear of death and the fiery passion of love both wrapped around each other. This is one of the most famous tales of our time, and to some extent there is a reason for it.But I have a confession to make here. Sometimes, you have to go against your most established principles even though you would prefer to stick with them. I have been thinking about this since I was in the middle of reading The Hunger Games, and I am still not sure about it, but I am going to say it anyway: the movie was better than the book.Still, I cannot escape the notion that this opinion was caused by the terrible decision to watch the movie without having read the book first. This is something I would only have done if I had no intentions of reading the book at all, and to be honest, that was the case here. I had written off this series completely, and I did not think I would ever end up reading it. So when I came home late from work one night and noticed that the movie would be shown on TV in 30 minutes, I thought ""Why not watch it? It's not like I'll ever read the book."" So I ended up watching the whole thing, enjoyed it a lot more than I had expected, and after that experience decided to give the books a chance after all.This is definitely a plot-driven novel, and that made it a rather disappointing experience to read while knowing practically everything about the plot. Plot-wise, there are very few differences between the book and the movie, those few being relatively unimportant scenes from the book which have been cut in the movie.The other aspects of the book are not particularly impressive. The writing is mediocre, with a present tense first person narrative which was not good at all. The characters are interesting enough, but suffers from comparison with the brilliant acting in the movie, where in my opinion the characters were actually heavily improved. Because of all this, I get the feeling that the book relies on the plot as its only major strength, and that the same plot is amazing enough to take the reader's attention away from the book's flaws.The only reason why I am giving this three stars is because it seems unfair to rate it based on a comparison with the movie adaptation, while praising that movie to the skies (I would probably give it five stars). Suzanne Collins has done a brilliant job of creating a captivating tale in a really interesting dystopian setting. So I will stick with this rating even though I am a bit disappointed, and instead expect more from the next couple of books.That said, I also feel the need to state that I did enjoy the book too. It is an astonishing novel which has put its mark on fictional literature, and I do not regret having read it. It also raises a lot of questions that I would really like to find the answers to, and I can only hope that Collins has managed to complete that task in the sequels. If you are one of the 17 people who have not yet read this book, I would definitely recommend it, but I would also urge you to read it before watching the movie. If you have already watched the movie, skip it.","Dec 27, 2014"

  “Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.”
I love The Hunger Games. I love those moments when I had nothing to do but reading this book all day. Suzanne Collins made her books phenomenal by creating a solid and attractive world where people are ruled by a dictator, Snow. Katniss Everdeen is an ordinary girl, but her life is changed forever after she volunteers to participate in the game that your life is just a stake for other people. That's so cruel, and it's a political matter intensifying this book to the highest level.
  “Destroying things is much easier than making them.” 
What I considered this one a meaningful read was the fact that I was pulled into this book from the start. The vibes were depressing. The characters were plain but real, they're all the same as us, the delicate beings. Collins delivered us this concept very well that I totally understood the gist of the book.It's never been so true that, in my opinion, THG is always my standard when I read other books that have the setting like this one. Why ? Because Collins successfully convinced me to believe that her book had a classic idea and influenced many dystopian novels these days. And look at that those books where their setting are post-apocalyptic worlds and people had to live in dystopain societies, still none of them are better than THG.
  “I don't want to lose the boy with the bread.”
 I do want to say many things about THG but don't know where to start them. I think the movie just shows what I want to say. The meaning of being humans being easily changed by the environment you live. Some small things can lead to very big things and cause some serious damage to a whole system.I'll come back when I have something to add into this review.

The country is called Panem. There are twelve poor districts governed by the rich Capitol, The Capitol organises the Hunger Games every year to punish the districts. One boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 fight in a battle. Only one person will live. The chosen teenagers are called “tributes”, Surprisingly I loved this movie a lot more than I thought I would.“May the odds be ever in your favor!” Katniss manages a meager living with her mother and sister ""Prim"", till one day her sister was chosen to be a “tribute”, but Katniss volunteers to go instead, The other “tribute” from District 12 was Peeta. ""The boy with the bread"" “If Peeta and I were both to die, or they thought we were....My fingers fumble with the pouch on my belt, freeing it. Peeta sees it and his hand clamps on my wrist. ""No, I won't let you."" ""Trust me,"" I whisper. He holds my gaze for a long moment then lets go. I loosen the top of the pouch and pour a few spoonfuls of berries into his palm. Then I fill my own. ""On the count of three?"" Peeta leans down and kisses me once, very gently. ""The count of three,"" he says. We stand, our backs pressed together, our empty hands locked tight. ""Hold them out. I want everyone to see,"" he says. I spread out my fingers, and the dark berries glisten in the sun. I give Peeta's hand one last squeeze as a signal, as a good-bye, and we begin counting. ""One."" Maybe I'm wrong. ""Two."" Maybe they don't care if we both die. ""Three!"" It's too late to change my mind. I lift my hand to my mouth taking one last look at the world. The berries have just passed my lips when the trumpets begin to blare. The frantic voice of Claudius Templesmith shouts above them. ""Stop! Stop! Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present the victors of the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark! I give you - the tributes of District 12!”","Oct 08, 2015"

Lo único bueno es, básicamente, que es entretenido.* Los personajes: muy sosos, mal desarrollados, sin gracia. Si vas a escribir un libro en el que sus protagonistas estén cara a cara con la muerte en todo momento, es necesario que estos tengan una buena definición. Debido a lo planos que son, me dio igual si se morían todos. Jamás me interesé por ninguno. * La narración de Collins es entre pesada, ligera e insoportable. La primera parte del libro se me hizo muy incómoda de leer por lo mal que estaba escrito. Ya en la segunda mitad no pude parar hasta llegar a la última página, quizá por costumbre. No me gusta cómo escribe.* No es original. Esto de ""personas matándose entre sí y quien queda es la ganadora"" es una idea muy simplona, básica. * Falta de profundidad en las emociones. Esto quizá tendría que entrar en el primer punto (la falta de desarrollo de los personajes), pero quiero resaltar el hecho de que haya poca introspección. Si Katniss quiere demostrar que no es una pieza de un juego, sino una persona con sentimientos, sueños, miedos, bueno... entonces debería habernos mostrado eso. Hubo pocas partes en las que se ve un plano emocional de la protagonista, y estas fueron superficiales.A pesar de lo dicho, es un libro para pasar el rato. Se lee rápido, es entretenido y muy adictivo. Pero no es nada especial y deja mucho que desear.","Apr 22, 2014"

I do have some thoughts I want to share.Plenty of people have pointed out (or complained) that the moviemakers go to a great deal of trouble not to show the contestants, including Katniss, killing one another. If you think about it, though, Katniss doesn't do a lot of killing herself. I think Collins was being very careful--if Katniss had been more of a killer in these games, parents would have screamed the ceiling down.But here's the thought I want to put out there. I wonder if Collins wasn't thinking more of Joan of Arc when she wrote Katniss: Joan, whose family was brutalized by English soldiers, who had a vision of a free France. Admittedly, the vision isn't Katniss's, but it's almost as if the vision of Katniss is the spark that the crushed people of Panem need to rise up. They'd had Games before and there wasn't a vision that caught them until the warrior girl was put before her. Yes, Katniss is maneuvered into things by the men in her life, particularly Haymitch, but once she gets mad, she has a knack for drawing people to her banner--like Joan.So call me bersorkey, I don't mind. Just thinkin me thinks. Back to my own war (on paper).","Sep 24, 2008"

I couldn't put it down. I watched the movie before ever knowing they were based on books so I knew what would happen, and yet it didn't really effect my reading experience. I didn't like Peeta in the movie. I dunno, but I really didn't. Book Peeta on the other hand, is really interesting and lovable. I really liked him. Katniss though, I'm very neutral about her. I was a bit bothered by somethings she thought of. The writing isn't really that great though. It was more tell than show, and I wasn't a fan of it. It was pretty devoid of emotion whatsoever.

"9780439023481","1805180","seak","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak","First, welcome to reading, I'm glad this could be one of 5 books you read this year along with The Help. Please stick around, there are many more worlds to explore and adventures to have. But I'm glad peer pressure can at least get you to read something. I know this is super elitist, I'm sorry, but I don't like pop music either and this is the Katy Perry of the literary world. I know, reading is always good blah blah blah it's still a good book blah blah you're kind of being a jerk here. I know but does anyone feel the same sometimes?This is my review from a couple years ago, forgot to post it here from the blog:I have this obsession, and I know it drives my wife nuts, but I can't stand wasting time. That's why audiobooks are by friends. Anytime I'm driving, taking the bus, walking to school, it's all good book-reading time. It's all forward progression, especially since I usually have goals to read so many books a month, quarter, year, etc. And I've found that most libraries have a decent selection of audiobooks since they tend to be a bit pricey.Now getting to the review. I'm terrible with peer pressure, I know. Everyone else seems to be reading this series and then I found it in the library. From there it was settled. (I'm still impressed I've resisted the Twilight fad for this long)Goodreads blurb: In a future North America, where the rulers of Panem maintain control through an annual televised survival competition pitting young people from each of the twelve districts against one another, sixteen-year-old Katniss's skills are put to the test when she voluntarily takes her younger sister's place.I came really close to giving up on The Hunger Games (Book 1 of 3) after the first few CDs. It was really frustrating how subservient these people are who live in each of the districts. They're on the brink of starvation, the rulers make it illegal to go hunting (although that's one place they actually break the rules), they can't say anything remotely seditious against the ruling class and to top it off they send two kids from each of their districts to compete in a ""game"" where they have to kill each other off - the winner is the one who out-survives the rest.The book explains that no one fights back because the elusive District 13 was utterly decimated. But seriously? People who are starving anyway have nothing to lose, a quick death by decimation is much better than slowly wasting away. Not only that, you have the parents. Who would continue to let their children go off to fight to the death and not do something about it, or at least just not be so submissive to everything?The kids arrive at the compound where they train and get ready for the games and yet again, they are completely afraid to break any rules. And yet again, what do they have to lose? They're about to go try to kill each other, why don't they do something? This is somewhat explained away because ""sponsors"" can help you throughout the game by sending you things you need and they'll only do that if they like you and you're in compliance with the rules.Yet, I couldn't help but think that people would still be fighting back. But anyway, once I got over these couple niggles, I did I promise, The Hunger Games was a fairly enjoyable read.Collins has created an interesting futuristic world where the ruling class keeps the people under their firm grasp by subjecting them to the horrible atrocities that are the Hunger Games. I thought she did a great job showing the intrigue of the games - that they were about more than just who's the biggest, strongest, fastest.Once the Hunger Games themselves began, I was sucked in. The game designers plan a number of surprises and tricks to not only weaken the players but to bring them together. Whatever gives the most entertainment for the legions of crowds watching the grisly show. These were all really interesting and helped to move the plot forward very quickly, because I, like the insensitive crowd, like my entertainment too. :)Almost immediately, the players created alliances (Survivor style) and it was interesting to see the dynamic especially since they all knew only one person would live. This was done quite well and even created some interesting twists.It's interesting to note that The Hunger Games have been optioned by Lions Gate films and I'll be interested to see the movie. You always have to see if they got it right. :)When Should You Read The Hunger Games?When you're in the mood for something light and definitely young adult, The Hunger Games may be the way to go. I'm probably the only one who had the issues I had with the book, so don't let that hold you back.3 out of 5 Stars (liked it)","Apr 03, 2010"
"9780439023481","4901961","Jay Kristoff","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4901961-jay-kristoff","Ok, so I realize I might be committing career suicide by not gushing from every orifice about the holiest of dystopian holies. I almost didn't write this review, because it's safer for new authors to just keep their heads down and say nothing because they might piss somebody off. But this world has enough liars already.I liked the Hunger Games. There were parts of it that were genuinely excellent. But would I name my firstborn daughter Katniss? Negative Ghost Rider, the pattern is full.(view spoiler)[Unlike most people who 3-star this book, my complaint isn't with the first act. I actually thought act 1 was the strongest of the three. I thought the Girl on Fire sequence made a great statement about the objectification of women in our society - in order to get sponsors and win over the crowd's affections, Katniss isn't made to look fierce or competent or badass - she's made to look PRETTY. This is a great analogy about the crap women deal with every day in professional and social circles. I also found the pace of the first act pretty brisk. By the end of it, I was thinking 'this book is kicking ass'.But then, the Games. Oh, the Games. Leave aside the blatant... homage to Koushun Takami's BATTLE ROYALE, or Stephen King's THE RUNNING MAN. I found the actual GAMES part of the HUNGER GAMES pretty dull. Which, I guess, is a big problem. I understand the author wanted to make Katniss a sympathetic hero. But unless I missed a murder somewhere, the victor of the 74th Hunger games kills exactly ONE PERSON in the whole book, and only after she's given moral permission when her victim brutally murders a 12 year old girl. This felt like Collins was passing the buck. You're writing a book about children slaughtering each other. We understand Katniss doesn't want to be there - we've forgiven her for anything she needs to do to survive. You don't need to justify her act of murder by flashing a big neon ""CHILD KILLER"" sign over the head of her (only) victim.So, without a truckful of murder, how do we fill in space? We've got two acts to fill, and there's only so much space you can take up with ""looking for water"" and ""eating"". The answer? Romance. In the middle of a murder zone. Bathed in the blood of innocent children. Lets make some moo cow eyes. /headdesk. I'm not raining on the romance parade, but Jesus, time and place, Peeta, neh?As for the finale? Again, these seemed an attempt to keep Katniss' hands clean. The competitors have conveniently polished each other off, leaving K, Peeta and a brutal soulless killer type, Cato. But Collins can't even seem to have Katniss punch the clock on this type 1 a-hole. Instead, she has some weird wolfoid things do the deed for her. PULL THE TRIGGER GIRL, FFS. It's ok, I don't want you to die! I give you permission to murder someone who's actively trying to PUT YOU IN THE GROUND. Look, the language was sparse, but tense. The action (when it actually happened - there's surprisingly little) is great. I really liked Katniss as a heroine - she's prickly, and hard and cold. She's not peaches and creamy and fuzzy bunnies - wonderful stuff and all too rare in the arena of YA. But if you're going to write a book about a group of children thrown into a bloody gladatorial contest, then DO IT. Don't drop a heroine into the thick of this world of pain, then have her hang around the periphery while the competitors all conveniently stab each other's faces to dying, and then finish off the remaining threat with a deus ex machina. (hide spoiler)]After I first put down this book, I really genuinely loved it. But on closer reflection, the things that bugged me remained, while the things I liked seemed to fade. And I guess the lasting impressions, rather than the fleeting ones, are the ones that count.","Jan 08, 2012"
"9780439023481","287915","[Name Redacted]","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/287915-name-redacted","After two years of hearing that this book is a new classic and that I simply MUST read it, i have finally given it a chance. I even spent a week listening to a very passionate woman insist that books like the Harry Potter series and ""The Giver"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale"" would soon be forgotten as ""The Hunger Games"" becomes the new standard, not only for Young Adult Literature but for all dystopian literature. Believing such claims invariably leads to disappointment, so I didn't expect to be blown away; i simply expected ""The Hunger Games"" to be a good piece of fast-paced YA pulp.Five pages in, I was not merely unimpressed, but legitimately sick of this novel. One of my more moderate friends admitted ""Well, the writing isn't great, but the story is good. You have to stick with it."" That was always a possibility, so I soldiered on, determined to give Collins a chance, and read all 374 pages. I even gave it a full day to simmer after finishing it. Alas, my initial impression stands, augmented and broadened by having read the other 369 pages: this is not a good book.The protagonist is, i am given to understand, supposed to be a strong, independent young woman; but as with Vin in the ""Mistborn"" series, she actually feels flat and lifeless, like a cardboard cut-out of what the author thinks a character is supposed to be. A lot of authors make this mistake when writing what are supposed to be strong female leads, and it is certainly not a ""male authors only"" problem. So for every Sabriel (Garth Nix) or Aerin (Robin McKinley) or Tiffany Aching (Terry Pratchett) there is also a Vin or a Bella or a Katniss Everdeen. By comparison, the love interest in ""Brazil"" felt stronger and better developed.The author's decision to write it in the first-person present-tense disconnects me from both the character and the narrative because the way she goes about it is so clumsy and irritatingly contrived. I actually believe i could excuse the terrible metaphors and the awful framing and the unnecessary sentence fragments if this were written in the past-tense as a sort of memoir; then all the errors and absurd word-choices and poor syntax could be written off as a product of the narrator herself. The choice of present tense eliminates that possibility however. Instead it seems to be a bizarre combination of inner-monologue and epistle, directed at someone outside of the author who requires explanations about things she or a resident of their world should already know, yet narrated as though it is a blow-by-blow account of what is happening to her right now.Things that struck me as I read this book: 1) Everything that other reviewers have pointed out. For instance:http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...2) If she's from a poor, backwoods region with a single, largely-absentee parent and has suffered poor hygiene and repeated starvation...why aren't her teeth rotten? It may seem like a silly little quibble, but we're supposed to understand that her family can't even afford the most basic supplies and is reliant on her hunting and selling in the blackmarket, and yet she's kept her teeth healthy and shiny enough that her stylists in the Capitol have nothing to say about them during the extended makeover scene?3) Why are there apparently SO MANY predatory animals and so few prey animals? She speaks repeatedly about how dangerous it is to go beyond the fence due to the wild predators, but also talks about how time-consuming and arduous it is trying to find a prey animal -- prey animals, by the way, that have evidently rarely-if-ever seen a human. That's not how it works! But apparently in the world of this book, you have to search all day to even kill a squirrel, while wolves and bears and cougars are all thriving...despite being squashed between a chemical-ravaged wasteland and human settlements.4) Does this world follow Harry Potter/My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic rules by having people's fates defined by the names they're given at birth? Why else would the baker boy be named ""Peeta"" and the girl who becomes an archer be named after the Sagittaria flower and the woman in charge of athletic training be named ""Atala"" and the guy in charge of the (fire-related!) makeover be named ""Cinna"" and the majority of the people in the Capitol be named after Roman aristocrats? I am reminded of one of my favorite sequences on The Simpsons: CLETUS: We always figured someday Mary would marry. That's why we called her ""Mary."" We name all our kids after what we think's gonna happen to 'em. Ain't that right, Stabbed-In-Jail?STABBED-IN-JAIL: [whittling a spear] We'll see who stabs who!5) If the story had focused on the minor character ""Rue"" it would have been a far more interesting and compelling book. She was the only character that actually elicited anything resembling an emotional reaction from me.6) The first 100 pages of the book were immensely uneven, plodding inexplicably as though through molasses at points, then breezing past parts where more information would have been appreciated.7) Was the fey male stylist character REALLY necessary?8) Apparently the arena is some sort of domed, man-made ecosystem a la ""The Truman Show"" and the people running it have an almost god-like level of environmental control which they only exercise at convenient moments in the narrative, and the people of the Capitol now only use their amazing indistinguishable-from-magic command of genetic engineering to create mutations for the games. There are probably plausible explanations (rationalizations) for all of that, but it just felt entirely too convenient that these things were only mentioned or deployed at specific points in the narrative -- as though Collins had written herself into a corner or thought ""Ooh, this would be neat!"" and just threw in a hasty bit of exposition in an attempt to hand-wave it all away. 9) Despite living in what amounts to the ""ghetto"" of an oppressive totalitarian state, and despite having no sources for history other than her state-mandated schooling, the protagonist somehow knows that the state is lying and covering up the true history of the very rebellion that led to her region being a ""ghetto""? Riiiiiiiiiiiiight...Overall, the pace is uneven, the characters lack both depth and emotional resonance (especially the protagonist/narrator), the obligatory adolescent love-triangle feels forced and ham-fisted, and I get the feeling that the author has very little understanding of the natural world. Elements are mentioned, then forgotten or ignored (for instance, there are apparently numerous predatory animals in the ""arena"" but none of the combatants ever face them -- except for mutated ones at the end which are unleashed specifically for the climax -- and the normal predators are only ever seen in the scene with the fire). I'm told by reliable sources that the series gets better with later books, but I don't think that's a risk I'm willing to take after this one. The first book should suck you in -- this one spat me out.For what it's worth though, it looks like they've made a genuinely compelling film out of this mediocre book!","Nov 11, 2010"
"9780439023481","3254923","Cory","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3254923-cory","The Hunger Games didn't impress me. When I'm reading a book, especially a speculative fiction book, the first thing I look for is illogical plot holes. I hate them. They ruin books for me. Take Death Note for instance, or even Glee. They are so full of plot holes and illogical inconsistencies, they aren't worth my time. If the author was too lazy to do a bit of research why should I invest myself in their work? That is how I feel about the Hunger Games. Sure, the writing isn't bad. I guess Katniss could be considered a strong female character. She kept it together and didn't freak out. She was tough and resilient. But sometimes you want more than that. I like snark, I like humor, I like cynicism. I know there isn't a place for that in most dystopian novels, but you have to make me love the characters. You have to give them some heart. Look at the Animorphs. We had humor and science. I think that's the thing most serious writers miss out on.But I digress. I started the Hunger Games with high expectations. I thought it would be mind blowing. It wasn't. Anyone who's read Octavia Butler or Philip K. Dick won't be impressed. Sure it's YA but honestly, is that an excuse for lazy world building?Panem is the remnants of the US divided into thirteen districts. The entire political and economical situation of Panem is highly illogical. This is my problem with Avatar: The Last Airbender. When you try to make sense out of the world, nothing fits. Then you're told that you're looking too hard into things, that it's a fantasy world. Sure it's a fantasy world, but we still have rules. If this were and alien world with an alien culture, maybe I'd agree. But this is still Earth. Last time I checked, they were still human. During slavery times in the US, slaves were looked at as less than human. Now I know the people of Panem aren't slaves. So why are they following this system? In Santa Domingo, the people were enslaved and forced to work for 300 years. They didn't have the freedom the people of Panem have. They rebelled, and after 10 years or so they won. They had to fight again and again, but they maintained their freedom from the French. Those people are the Haitians of today.Let's look at any civil war situation on the globe. The closest situation I can think of is in Southern Africa. There, children are forced to fight in wars and carry guns. They kill each other. There, they have their hands cut off if they refuse to fight. Did I mention that they're also in a complete system of disarray? I don't believe that Americans can safely travel there. Why isn't Panem like this? I could have accepted the Hunger Games as a whole if, and only if, their country was in a complete state of havoc. It isn't. Apparently each of the districts get along just fine, supplying the capital with goods. What's with that?And the kicker is, their Ghandi figure, their Martin Luther King Jr., is a teenage girl and her boyfriend. This is our symbol to teens. Apparently, teen love does stop wars, the Earth, and the universe. Look over here, teens fall in love and the gods present us with peace and tranquility for years to come. Yes, the books only continue to get even more illogical. For a system like this to work, I'd have to have a lot of back story to explain the country's situation. I understand that district 13 was blown off the face of the Earth. So was part of Japan for a period of time. You know, some say they don't even teach their kids about WWII over there. But did that stop the Korean War? Did that stop Vietnam? No. And you can bet those wars weren't started by the love of two teens. This series could have been brilliant. It had excellent potential. Unfortunately, besides the illogical world building and the gaping plot holes, there's a problem with pacing.The actual Hunger Games doesn't start until at least one third of the book is over. That's bad pacing. If this were a movie, that's like Nemo getting kidnapped one third of the way into the movie. Also, we waste time building up Gale and Priss, only to find out that they're not even major players in this book. I know it's a series, but a book should be able to stand on it's own. The Chronicles of Narnia do. The first three Harry Potter books do. Instead, we're stuck with Peeta. He's okay, but he's not interesting. The romance felt tacked on. If the capital is swayed by their ridiculous love story, I swear, they're no better than a bunch of Rose/Dimitri fan girls. Also, we're introduced to interesting characters, such as Haymitch, Cinna, and so on, only for them to be left out of the rest of the book. Either this is a post-apocalyptic/action novel or a character study. It can't be both unless you write it well. It certainly can't be a romance if the heroine isn't even sure she likes the Hero. It was kind of obvious from the first few chapters that Katniss liked Gale. It was even more obvious that he liked her. Of course it has to be strung out into a love triangle for the next few books. *Spoiler* Of course he goes evil and she ends up with Peeta.*End Spoiler*There was so much hype behind this book, I expected it to be fantastic. Maybe if it wasn't so popular, I'd have a different opinion. But as it is, bad pacing and stupid world building are not the hallmarks of a fabulous novel.3.0 stars. It's about as average as they come.","Jun 03, 2010"
"9780439023481","20408288","Will M.","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20408288-will-m","This is my very first reread ever, and also my very first audiobook. I was expecting to enjoy it a lot more, but sadly the book didn't have that same effect on me the first time around. Almost everyone knows what the Hunger Games is about. I don't see it necessary to discuss or give a short summary of it anymore. There are 100,000+ reviews on it already, and it has the highest number of ratings here on goodreads. In short, this is the most read book here on goodreads. There is one reason why I chose to reread this. My favorite author is Stephen King, and the reason how that happened was because of this book. After reading this and the second book, the hype was not that prominent then, so I haven't heard much of the series from people. People were talking about other hyped up series, but I stumbled upon this accidentally. I had to research on people's reaction toward the third novel, and I saw this review that said  This is a complete ripoff of Stephen King's The Long Walk and The Green Mile.  I enjoyed the series a lot then, but that certain review made me curious on who this King guy was. I was 14 years old then, so I wasn't reading much adult/horror material then. After finishing Mockingjay, I decided to go ahead and try out The Long Walk (it was 2013 then, so I was 17), and I loved it. I ended up reading a lot more King novels and that resulted to me considering King as my favorite author. So in a way, this series introduced me to Stephen King, so I decided that I owed it a reread and a review at least.My rating when I first read this was 4 stars, maybe even a 4.5, but my reading preference had change over the years. I'm not trying to be part of the minority here by hating on YA books, but almost all of the YAs I've read lately were terrible and shallow. This does not fall under the terrible and shallow pile, but it wasn't as good as it was before. The characters were still pretty decent, but I realized how the plot wasn't as violent anymore. Realistically speaking it is quite terrifying, but I realized that the execution was not. Rather than concentrating on the horrors of what the games can offer, Collins decided to build up the relationship of Katniss and Peeta. I'm not particularly fond of that, but I guess other teenagers are.I believe another factor that affected my rating would be the fact that I listened to this. I'm not a fan of audiobooks, that I can conclude. It might be because I didn't like the one who narrated this, but I think it's really audiobooks in general. The one who narrated this used a robotic voice that was fun at first, but got old quick. I might try out another audiobook and see if I'll change my opinion. I'm not going to listen to the second and third book anymore though.3.5/5 stars. It wasn't as awesome as it was before, but I guess it was still a good novel, and one of the good YA ones. If you're an avid YA reader and you haven't read this, then you're missing out on a lot. Everyone should at least give this one a try and see if they'll enjoy it or not.","Jan 03, 2015"

The Hunger Games trilogy was the first YA story I read that treated youngs with both respect and coldness, without filters and right to the point. It set the bar so high for me that after it, every book in the genre I have read is simply not good enough. This first installment gives us an incredibly strong, fierce, human main charachter with a perfect development, a society eerily allegorical to our reality, with a moral of respect and love among the most desperate of situations. The Hunger Games is a very complete story and a perfect first-book-in-series. No recuerdo como me entere de la existencia de este libro, creo que fue cuando adquirieron los derechos para la película, o no recuerdo, pero tras haberlo leído, encendió una chispa por la lectura que hasta la fecha no he podido apagar. A la fregada, le daré las 5 estrellas por que se las merece, punto final. Me he leído libros muy buenos en toda mi vida, de verdad, libros mucho muy buenos, pero la gran mayoría solo se quedan en eso, y luego están estos otros que hacen que me meta tanto en la historia, que hacen que me preocupe tanto por sus personajes que al final solo quiero que todo acabe bien para ellos.  Los Juegos del Hambre es ESE tipo de libros. Collins hace un gran trabajo como escritora, el primer libro siempre es el más difícil, hay que saber dar a entender la trama general y el personaje principal de manera al menos buena, o todo se cae. Y Collins lo hace estupendamente. En muy pocas hojas te das cuenta de la situación de Panem como país, del Distrito 12 como comunidad y de Katniss Everdeen como personaje. Entiendes la perversidad detrás de los juegos, pero no es si no hasta mas adelante, como a la mitad del libro que te das cuenta de porque le han funcionado tan bien al Capitolio por 74 años. Es tan fácil manipular cuando se juega con el instinto mas poderoso y arcaico de todos; el de supervivencia.Me gustan los personajes con metas simples pero importantes en la vida, y Katniss no es mas que eso, una persona con tan poco, que puede contar las personas que le importan con los dedos de las manos, que no puede aspirar a algo grande. Y leer como pasa de ser una chica de mente cerrada, distante y con solo un objetivo que seguir a este personaje fuerte pero con emociones, inteligente pero con necesidad, arrogante pero con caridad y con una visión más amplia del mundo en el que habita es simplemente fascinante. Su cambio de ACTITUD conforme pasa el libro me hace tenerle más y más respeto a pesar de no estar de acuerdo con muchos de sus pensamientos o acciones.Katniss aprende gracias a Rue y Peeta que la única manera de vencer a los Juegos del Hambre es mediante la unión, respetar y defender la vida de otra persona como respetas y defiendes la tuya. Que se puede ser humano aun cuando todo a tu alrededor te impide que lo seas. Y un libro que es capaz darte pensamientos tan positivos creando un mundo con tanta negatividad y dolor merece todas las buenas críticas que tiene.  #HungerGamesFanAndProud El libro tiene otra cosa muy importante a resaltar y es: LA TELEVISION! Los reality TV Shows y toda esa mierda asquerosa! Nombren el que ustedes quieran, da igual porque ES UNA MIERDA! Enserio, cual es el siguiente paso?. Da tanto miedo saber lo fácil con que se manipula a las masas por medio de la televisión. Y así puedo seguir, todo el día, hablando sobre porque este libro y esta historia es tan buena y perfecta dentro de toda su imperfección. En cuanto a los personajes secundarios, aunque no se ve mucho crecimiento por su parte, me gusta que sean todos tan variados. Me encantan las personalidades tan distintas de Katniss y Peeta, me encanta todo lo que aprende de el, y como se complementan. Soy una fan de las parejas con personalidades distintas, o tal vez no soy fan de las parejas con personalidades iguales, no lo se, el punto es que hay muy pocas historias románticas que me llenen y la de Katniss y Peeta es una de ellas. :'DAgregándole que el libro tiene muy buena información de supervivencia, y buenas escenas de acción, un ritmo muy fluido y una seguridad en su propia historia digna de aplaudirse. No creo que tenga que decir esto dado todo lo que ha crecido esta historia por si sola y ahora con las películas (que me encantan por cierto) pero si por alguna razón extraña no lo has leído, dale una oportunidad. Altamente recomendado.Como le hace? Enserio, como le hace esta mujer Suzanne Collins? Dios mío! Había olvidado por completo lo tristes, crueles y horribles que eran los últimos capítulos. Lo mucho que tocan la fibra sentimental. La autora termina el libro con un desgarro emocional impresionante. Y es que en la película no es tan intenso el final. En tan pocas hojas, te hace llorar, enojar, odiar y querer. Te da esperanza, te la quita, te la vuelve a dar, te la vuelve a quitar, y de paso, destroza todos los corazones Everlark! Te deja llorando en posición fetal. D: y con muchas, muchas ganas de leer el siguiente.*ni yo me la creo*LA PELÍCULA:Me gusto. Bastante. Salí de esa sala muy feliz y contenta con la adaptación, las actuaciones, etc. No, no fue perfecta, pero es sin duda el mejor inicio de franquicia que he visto. Mucha gente se queja de que la cámara se movía mucho, pero yo nunca lo sentí, al contrario hacia que todo se viera mas real, como si estuvieras ahí detrás de Katniss corriendo. Sin duda lo mas fuerte es el casting, sobretodo Katniss y Snow. Si alguno de los dos hubiera fallado, TODA esta franquicia hubiera muerto, pero esos dos lo LOGRARON! Hice todo lo que una fangirl haría, grite, se me salieron lagrimas, reí, salte, aplaudí, pero lo mejor de todo, después al salir de la película e intentar verla con ojo critico, pude decir, ES UNA BUENA PELÍCULA! No todos los fandoms pueden decir eso gente, así que por favor agradezcan!","Apr 19, 2012"

I read this book in a day.--------------------------------------------Dear Ms Collins,I think I speak on behalf of most young adult readers when I say thank you for writing a series that allows us to say “I told you so” when every single person we recommend the book to devours it within a day and adores it.I may be speaking for myself here but when I say “I read the books before I saw the film” about the Hunger Games, I will say it loud and proud and smugly.Thank you for showing everyone that it’s OK to be a Katniss kinda gal.Forever a fan,Jo.x------------------------------------------Dear Katniss,Compassionate. Brutal. Awkward. Strong. Loyal. Looks good with a side plait. [It’s a difficult look to pull off, believe you me.]It’s all been said before and I hope it gets said again and again. With you, we readers finally got a heroine who wasn’t afraid to stand up for what they believe in. And also, a heroine who didn’t just believe in boys and kissing.You are the ultimate.Yours always,Jo.xxxps. I have also been keeping track of the boy with the bread. When I say ‘keep track of’ I mean ‘fancied the pants off’….------------------------------------Dear Peeta,It struck me when I read Katniss’ 100% true memoir the entirely fictional account of the 74th Hunger Games how hilarious you are. For some reason, I forgot this in the lull between the first reading of the book and the second reading. I like how you are actually a character with your own personality and not just one of the tired YA boy clichés that get paraded out when the heroine needs to look ‘feminine’ and ‘normal’ and less “squirrel-killery”. Because, obviously, kissing boys is the only way this can be done, right?Anyway, I think I have done you a great disservice by describing you as the ‘nice’ guy when I have been recommending this book to my family and my friends and that weird woman who wouldn’t leave me alone when I was waiting at the train station.So, for that, I apologise.I mean, you are nice but you also have an incredibly dry humour which I adore so much.“You here to finish me off, sweetheart?”“Yes, frosting. The final defence of the dying.”“Remember, we’re madly in love, so it’s all right to kiss me any time you feel like it.”You’re also so incredibly swoony and I would like to cuddle in a cave with you while you whisper sweet nothings into my ear.And when I say ‘cuddle in a cave’ I mean in a fancy restaurant where an oddly attractive psychopath isn’t out for our blood. And there would probably be profiteroles.And when I say ‘sweet nothings’ I mean recipes for delicious cakes...It will be a cold day in hell when I don’t fancy a boy who can provide me with regular baked products.I LOVE BREAD AND I LOVE YOU.Lots of love,Jo.xxx--------------------------G-I always root for the underdog.“Catnip”*sigh*Also, I always root for the tall, fit hunter-gatherer type who would always be there to protect the heroine but lets her protect herself because he knows she could do it just as well, if not better, than he could and he respects that and encourages her strength.Probs just me.--------------------------Haymitch, mate, you need to ring me.You left your phone at my house and god it’s been ringing off the hook. Effie really wanted to speak to you, dunno what about. I listened to some of the messages (God, she’s shrill, isn’t she?) and all I got from it was that Katniss needed you to get her something. Something about Katniss not being able to find water and needing you to send her some? Or else she was gonna die? Ha. Effie is such a drama queen, isn’t she?Does that make any sense to you?Nah, I didn’t get it either.Anyway, last Friday was BRILLIANT. Remember? We got really drunk and we ended up on that pedalo? And then we were in that club and you requested Mysterious Girl by Peter Andre from the DJ and I was like “THIS SONG IS ALL ABOUT ME!” and you were like “OMG THIS SONG REALLY IS ALL ABOUT YOU!!…..You really don’t remember?Anyway, we need to do that again because us two, H? We’re in it for the long haul. I know what happens in the Capitol stays in the Capitol but I guess it’s also the law…‘Til Sambuca do us part,Jo.xxxps. Do you have my left shoe? I’ve looked all over Panem and I can’t find it.-----------------------------Dearest Cin,Can I call you Cin? You never replied to my other letter so I’m guessing it’s OK. Anyway, Cin… speaking of those other letters, do you have an answer for me?Would you be willing to be my Life Coach? I know it would be a bit of a task because, well, I’m pretty much failing at all things life-related but this is where you come in.Just picture it, we could go shopping. We could talk about make-up. You could diagnose what the hell is going on with my hair. We could talk about politics.Me and Katniss are practically best friends too, so you could go ahead and book is in on the same session.It’ll be glorious and just think how satisfying it would be to succeed. We could do a Before and After kind of thing. Or make it into a reality TV show?!?!We could be the next Audrey and Rex!Anyway, I’ve included a self-addressed envelope just in case you lost my address.Can’t wait to hear back from you!xoxoxops. I spent about three hours in Boots looking at gold eye-liner last weekend. I just couldn’t decide whether I would suit it or not. I think it takes a certain kind of person to wear that colour, you know? So instead I went to get a meal deal but the woman on the til said I couldn’t have two brownies and a Diet Coke instead of a sandwich, a brownie and a Diet Coke. So I glowered at her for a bit and bought the two brownies anyway and then added another one to my basket IN PROTEST. And I refused to get an advantage card. TO SPITE HER.pps. See? Life failing, thy name is Jo. HELP.----------------------------Dear Rue,You know when you’re trying to sleep in in the mornings and there’s that bloody annoying bird outside your window that is just screeching and squawking and you’re just like “HOLY MOCKINGJAY WOULD YOU SHUT UP?!?!?”That was me trying to send you a message via a wood pigeon. I learnt too late that they are not Mockingjays and they do not have the ability to send messages.So… um.. sorry for the squawking and disturbing your Sunday lie-ins.Basically, I just wanted to say that you’re a wonderful little girl and if I think about it really hard, you’re the starting point for everything that happens in this book.Love you,Jo.xxx----------------------------Dearest Finnick,Yes, I know you’re not in this book but I wanted to just let you know that I will be reading Catching Fire again in the near future and I am SO EXCITED because you are one of my favourite real life fictional boys ever.Also, I have missed it when you take off your top randomly and show your abs.KISSES AND ETERNAL LOVE FOREVER AND EVER,Jo.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx---------------------------------Dear Jennifer Lawrence,I can’t decide whether I am more in love with your boyfriend or you.Who am I kidding? It's totally you.I don’t know what this means.Best wishes,Jo.xxxps. You don’t happen to still have Michael Fassbender’s number, do you?You can read this review and lots of other exciting things on Wear the Old Coat.","Mar 20, 2011"
"9780439023481","7355135","B0nnie","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7355135-b0nnie","*****spoilers*****Like everyone else, I was drawn to the underdog of The Hunger Games. The unfairness of the games is probably the thing that bothered me the most, how some of the contestants were so much better prepared than others.Look, here you have a bunch of kids, yanked from their homes, sent to fight to the death. There is the underdog contestant. She had little chance of winning. And there's that other contestant who's by far the most qualified to win, and has basically been trained from birth, fully hard-ass enough to survive. This other character has such astonishing intuition that it is almost on par with Edward Cullen's mind reading skills (oddly though, except when something is completely obvious). Further, any moral dilemmas - such as having to kill friends - are taken care of by outside forces. And cornered? No problem, there'll be something handy within reach to solve the problem. Talk about born under a lucky star.So yeah, things always worked out for Katniss.Then you have that other contestant who is far less lucky. Smaller, yet shrewd, observant, intelligent, able to replicate complicated patterns, at first able to avoid getting killed. Not attacking the others. Having no weapon skills, just hoping to survive by default. Her clever and risky idea at the Cornucopia worked so well that it brought on a fit of jealousy from Katniss - probably in the same mean spirit that inspired her to come up with the nickname ""Foxface"". Why not something less catty, say for example ""Vixen"" - which still plays on the fox reference yet also to female beauty and cleverness. Vixie for short, I should think. Vixie never, ever called Katniss ""Arrowheadface"". Nor Peeta ""Doughface"". I felt the full weight of the evil of this contest when Vixie died so tragically and so very ironically. Her laughter, her unique abilities, her sleek red hair, gone, gone with a handful of berries. The mean trick fate played on her with those berries was so opposite to the luck that always went to Katniss. Here I felt the pain of living in a dystopia like Panem, where some are given advantages and others are not. My tears were flowing as I read Miss V's final moment: ""What’s left of Foxface’s emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight.""And then later when attacked by the mutts, all Katniss can think of is “It’s her!” continuing her weird jealous obsession with the one girl that could've beaten her - if the games hadn't been so fixed in Katniss's favour.Poor poor, unlucky thing. No fantastic Mr. Fox for you, no Jamie, no D. H. Lawrence, dear Miss Vixie. No, life is not Fair & Balanced.I leave this  musical tribute  for you.","Feb 02, 2012"
"9780439023481","2969647","Maciek","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek","Okay, so as Milan pointed out everybody and their dog is reading this series, so I did too! It sounded exciting, fast-paced with action, romance and adventure, set in a dystopian society where children are forced to participate in deatchmatches which are a form of official entertainment. What more could a reader want?Well, it turned out that this reader could want quite a lot more. Since I am a well known reading snob who only reads mass-markets found in drugstores and at bus stops I'm going to bitch what I didn't like, but first I'll say what I liked. Well, the cover is nice, and so is the title, but that's about it.Set in post-apocalyptic North America, The Hunger Games instantly brings to mind Battle Royale, the book or the film. Add to these cool teenage protagonists, some sort of Anime cosplay costumes designed by cool designers (in this book you go to the scaffold with style!) and you should have the latest teen craze which would disappear from shelves like my grandmother's homemade pierogies when I'm in her town. And, of course, you'd be right.Only The Hunger Games is nowhere near as meaty as good pierogies, even those with cheese stuffing. It's a very quick read, because the writing style is rather simplistic. The present tense narrative should allow for closeness and attachment to the main character, Katniss, and her feelings and emotions, only either I'm getting old or am a bastard because I found it hard to give a crap about what she thinks or feels. Maybe the character was just flat as a board, or I'm getting to old for this, since this is a book aimed at teenagers. I failed to care about any of the characters and found most events to be unsurprising except for a weird thing which occured near the end of the book, but it was not quite enough to save it as a whole for me. I found the romance part to be quite emotionless and the only chemistry to be found was in the big apple which I ate when reading this book because it was as big as a tire. So, the straight forward writing serves the action scenes well, and to give the author credit there's a lot of them but they're all that there is to it, and such themes and motives have been carried out earlier by other writers.To sum up: The Hunger Games reads like a bag of chips, meaning you can devour it in several short bites but it will leave you unnourished and aside from some gas won't have much effect. If you'll pardon the pun, it left me hungry. I might still read the other two books in the series because they read so fast and you can always do with more bragging about the number of books you've read, and there's supposed to be a rebellion or something in the second one and the third one has a cool title. Stay tuned!","Sep 20, 2011"

In about three-and-a-half hours the midnight showings of The Hunger Games will begin on the east coast—and now I can officially state that I read the book before it was ruined by those Hollywood bastards and avoid being classified as a johnny-come-lately, if only by a ridiculously infantile technicality. So what I was thinking was this: What the world needs now isn't love, sweet love; it's another review of The Hunger Games. You see, beating a dead horse is for amateurs. I like to beat a bottle of glue. (Now that's takin' passé to a whole 'nother level.)Does loving The Hunger Games make me a humungous girl? Well, then, you better install my fallopian tubes pronto—because this book thrilled and engrossed me. I spent hours when I could have been masturbating to internet porn reading The Hunger Games instead. I just couldn't stop reading this dagnab thing. Katniss Everdeen—the heroine of said young adult dystopian novel—bewitched me with her archery, her flaming headgear, and her knowledge of mutant wasps. What I really liked about her was that she wasn't a complete moron like another female heroine of a YA literary phenomenon who shall remain nameless. She's actually complex in a way that klutzy, weather-obsessed Phoenix transplant could never be.","Mar 22, 2012"
"9780439023481","5008212","فهد الفهد","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5008212","مباريات الجوع عندما قرأت عن هذه الرواية، ومن ثم قرأتها فيما بعد، كان أول ما طرأ على بالي هو أن الفكرة ليست جديدة تماما ً، فقد استخدمها (ستيفن كينج) في روايته (الرجل الراكض) والتي نشرت سنة 1982 م – ترجمها بنفس العنوان د. أحمد خالد توفيق في سلسلة روايات عالمية، بينما ترجمت ونشرت مؤخرا ً عن طريق مكتبة جرير تحت عنوان (الهارب) -، استخدمها أيضا ً الياباني كوشون تاكامي سنة 1999 م في روايته (معركة رويال) التي شاهدت الفيلم المقتبس منها، هذا غير تشابه الفكرة مع حفنة أخرى من الروايات إما بشكل أو بآخر. رغم كل هذا، إلا أن العبقرية دائما ً تكمن في التفاصيل، وهذا يعلمنا أن الفكرة لا تموت، نعم تهرم من كثرة الاستخدام، ولكنها لا تموت، بل هي تنتظر الكاتب الذكي الذي سيأتي وينشب فيها أظفاره بحيث يجلو عنها كل الطبقات التي غطتها، سيأتي ويفتتح طريقا ً جديدا ً للفكرة، شيئا ً يأخذها إلى أبعد مما فعل الآخرون. هل فعلت سوزان كولينز هذا في روايتها هذه؟ أو لنقل هل هذا ما ستفعله في ثلاثيتها عن (مباريات الجوع)؟ لا يمكنني أن أقول رأيا ً كاملا ً، وأنا لم اقرأ إلا الجزء الأول فقط، وينتظرني (ألسنة اللهب) و(الطائر المقلد)، وهما الجزءان اللذان أتطلع إلى قراءتهما، ولكنني سأعتمد على هذا الجزء الأول لأظهر الجديد والجميل في هذا الشكل الأحدث من الفكرة. ولكن ما هي الفكرة؟ ما الذي أغرى كل هؤلاء الكتاب وجعلهم يكتبونها؟تنبيه: ما سيأتي قد يكشف شيئا ً من أحداث هذه الرواية وروايات أخرى مشابهة. الفكرة هي عن مستقبل مظلم للبشرية، مستقبل يتفكك فيه المجتمع بحيث يصل إلى مرحلة يستعيد فيها تقاليد رومانية بادئة، ولكن هذه المرة بإهاب عصري، حيث يعيد الناس افتتاح كوليسيوم عصري، يلقى فيه المجالدون حتفهم فقط لإسعاد الجمهور الجديد، الذي لم يعد يثيره إلا الرعب الحقيقي، ومشاهد الدماء الحقيقية. تقول المؤلفة أن فكرة الكتاب جاءتها وهي تقلب قنوات التلفاز ذات يوم، حيث ترابطت القنوات التي تعرض برامج الواقع، مع القنوات الإخبارية التي تعرض تغطيات الحروب، هذا غير ذكرى الأسطورة اليونانية عن المونيتور، حيث كانت أثينا مرغمة على إرسال أبنائها إلى كريت حيث يلتهمهم وحش أسطوري يعيش في متاهة مرعبة، هذا طبعا ً قبل أن يقصم عمره ثيسوس. قد تبدو لنا في الوقت الحالي فكرة عودة مثل هذه التجارب المرعبة التي عاشتها البشرية زمنا ً مستحيلة، ولكننا في الواقع على بعد خطوة واحدة من ذلك، فشغف الناس بأفلام الرعب، وأفلام الحركة حيث يموت العشرات على الشاشة، وحيث يصل العنف ذروته، هذا غير ألعاب الفيديو التي تجعل الشخص يمارس العنف بنفسه، ثم الاهتمام بالرياضات التنافسية التي يضرب فيها المشارك خصمه إلى حدود الموت تقريبا ً، مثل الملاكمة والمصارعة، وأخيرا ً برامج تلفزيون الواقع التي يستمتع فيها المشاهد بتخطي المشاركين لحدود الوضع البشري الطبيعي، إما بالفضائح أو محاولة البقاء والتغلب على الآخرين، كل هذا يعلمنا أن بذرة العنف موجودة في النفس البشرية، وأن تغييرا ً سياسيا ً يزيل الغطاء المجتمعي قد يولد من العنف ما لا يمكن تخيله. ندع هذا كله ونعود إلى الفكرة، طرح ستيفن كينج هذه الفكرة كما قلت في روايته (الرجل الراكض)، حيث يشترك البطل في إحدى هذه المسابقات الجحيمية ليوفر ثمن الدواء لطفلته المريضة وليعيل زوجته التي تحولت إلى عاهرة لتوفر لهم المال، حيث لا يستطيع هو العمل لأنه بكل بساطة على قائمة سوداء، تمنعه من العمل، فكرة اللعبة التي يشارك فيها والتي تحمل اسم الرجل الراكض أو الهارب، هي أن يعطى مبلغا ً صغيرا ً من المال وكاميرة فيديو، يجب أن يستخدمها ليرسل رسالتين مسجلتين يوميا ً أثناء فترة هروبه، حيث تنطلق بعد 12 ساعة من بداية اللعبة، قوات متخصصة تتعقبه وتحاول قتله، يربح المشارك 100 دولار عن كل ساعة تمضي، و100 دولار عن كل رجل شرطة يقتله، وإن استطاع الصمود والبقاء حتى 30 يوما ً، يحصل على الجائزة الكبرى وهي مليار دولار، يبدع ستيفن كينج كثيرا ً في هذا الكتاب حتى نهايته المفاجئة بل والعبقرية. في المقابل كانت رواية الياباني تاكامي عبارة عن يابان مستقبلية، يخطف فيها الجيش طلاب مدرسة ثانوية، ويقوم بإخضاعهم لتجربة تجعلهم يقاتلون فيها بعضهم البعض حتى الموت. عندما نكون قد قرءنا وشاهدنا هذه الفكرة من قبل، ما الذي نريده من رواية جديدة تعيد طرح الفكرة ذاتها من جديد؟ دائما ً وأبدا ً التفاصيل هي من يصنع الفرق، قدرة الروائي على إعادة تركيب الفكرة بطريقة مبدعة، وإثرائها بأفكار وتفاصيل جديدة، هي ما يصنع الفارق لدى القارئ. في هذه الرواية نحن في المستقبل من جديد، أمريكا تفككت وحلت مكانها دولة تدعى بانيم، وهي عبارة عن 13 مقاطعة تحكمها مدينة حصينة بنيت على جبال روكي، تسمى الكابيتول، حاولت هذه المقاطعات الثورة على الكابيتول، ولكن تم سحق التمرد، وأبيدت المقاطعة الثالثة عشرة تماما ً، وفرض على المقاطعات الباقية إرسال فتى وفتاة سنويا ً للمشاركة في (مباريات الجوع)، ومباريات الجوع هي ميدان واسع يلقى فيه المشاركون ويتركون ليقتلوا بعضهم البعض حتى لا يعود هناك إلا منتصر واحد، يحصل على الثروة والمجد ويعود إلى مقاطعته، التي تنال بدورها نصيبا ً وافرا ً من الطعام لذلك العام، كيف يتم اختيار المشاركين؟ بالقرعة بين كل أبناء المقاطعة الذين تتراوح أعمارهم ما بين 12 و18 عاما ً، أو بأن يتطوع أحدهم للمشاركة، وهذا ما يفعله عادة ً المحترفون من أبناء المقاطعات الغنية، والذين تم تدريبهم جيدا ً بحيث تحولوا إلى آلات للقتل، طبعا ً كل ما يجري في الميدان ينقل مباشرة إلى جميع أرجاء بانيم. في العام الرابع والسبعين من بداية مباريات الجوع، نتعرف على (كاتنيس ايفردين) فتاة في السادسة عشرة من عمرها، توفي والدها وتركها ووالدتها وأختها الصغيرة بريم، ولأن الأم دخلت في حالة من الاكتئاب الحاد، صارت كاتنيس هي من يعيل العائلة الصغيرة عن طريق الصيد في الغابة، رغم أن القانون يمنع هذا، حيث كانت المقاطعة الثانية عشرة وهي أفقر المقاطعات مكلفة بتوفير الفحم، يضع حظ بريم السيئ، الفتاة الصغيرة في مواجهة الموت من أول سنة تشارك فيها، فتتطوع كاتنيس لتحل مكانها، ويقع الاختيار على صبي خباز يدعى (بيتا ميلارك) ليكون الفتى المرشح من المقاطعة الثانية عشرة التي ينتمي لها الاثنان. تأخذنا المؤلفة إلى الكابيتول حيث نعايش ما يحدث خطوة بخطوة، من تقديم المشاركين للجمهور إلى تحضيرهم للقتال، وحتى اللحظة التي يدفعون فيها إلى الميدان، حيث نتابع القتال الشرس الذي يدور، ونتابع بكل إعجاب شخصيتي كاتنيس وبيتا الجذابتين، وتحالفهما ونكتشف الحب الذي كان بيتا يكنه لكاتنيس منذ طفولته، وكيف أنقذهما هذا الحب من الموت مرات. القصة لم تنتهي بالطبع، لازال هناك جزءين، صحيح أن كاتنيس وبيتا انتصرا في مباريات الجوع، ولكنهما الآن يواجهان ما هو أخطر، يواجهان الكابيتول الذي تحدياه والذي سيتأكد بأن هذه الثورة الصغيرة لابد أن تنتهي بأسرع ما يمكن. تميزت الرواية كما قلت باهتمام المؤلفة بتفاصيل المباريات، وبناءها للشخصيات وخاصة شخصية كاتنيس، والتي ستؤدي دورها في الفيلم المقتبس من الرواية، الموهوبة (جينيفر لورنس) التي تميزت في العام الماضي في فيلم (Winter's Bone).","Dec 07, 2011"

I just think this is one of the best books ever. The whole package: story, writing, characters, pacing... it hits all my feels and is everything I'm looking for in a book. There was nothing that annoyed me. There is a hint of a love triangle, but it's so minor in this first book that it's almost not even a factor whatsoever. The author really succeeded in making the reader care for the characters very quickly and easily. I was drawn right into the story from the very beginning.I just think it's freaking brilliant.

And may the odds be ever in your favor.”So I read this book first when the movie came out, in Dutch, and it has always been one of my favorite books ever. This is actually one of the first books I’ve ever read for fun in my life and I’m so excited that I can talk about it in a review for the first time. After reading this I realized again why it is my favorite book again, and it’s only flaw is that I wanted more. From everything.Note: Since I already read the book and have seen the movie like four times I won’t go into detail to much about the plot and the twists since I know them like the back of my hand.Contains spoilers for the whole ‘The Hunger Games’ series (but who hasn’t read this?) !
  Design (5,0 stars) 
One of the main reasons for reading this book again, besides it being my favorite and wanting to re-experience it again, was because I have wanted the beautiful hardbacks for years now, and I was finally able to get my hands on them. They are absolutely gorgeous and I love the design so much. I’m so in love with the mockingjay on the front of the naked hardcovers and I just love the designs inside the book that matches the contents of this book really well.Start of the book (5,0 stars) From the first word in this book I was just sucked in the world again. The writing style was amazing, Katniss was amazing, the world building. I was so happy to be back reading this plot again.
  The writing style (5,0 stars) 
So since it is technically the first time I read Suzanne Collin’s words, without being translated, I can judge that fairly. The writing style in this book was perfect, it had the right amount of anything. The right amount of world building, of humor, of character building, of descriptions, of main character thinking, of tension, of combat, of pacing etc… It made me laugh, it made me cry, it was just prefect! She can tell so much on one page, and write action so well and clear. I also want to comment how much I loved being in Katniss her head, it felt like a story she was telling me personally. Even after knowing what the next page would contain, I still couldn’t stop reading. I do have one tiny remark though (but it wasn’t really necessary because maybe it would have made the book longwinded), that I as a diehard fan of this trilogy would have appreciated. That was more information about the other candidates and districts. I mean we only get to hear like 6 challenge scores, we only know 10 names, we only get 5 outfit descriptions here and there out of the 24 contestants so that was a missed opportunity I thought to make it more personal and rememberable. 
  The world building (5,0 stars) 
I completely forgot how great this world building is. How much history is put in this book to back up all the current cruelty. I absolutely love the design of the hunger games and the capitol with the surrounding districts and all the other details. I also loved the addition of the muttants, they were so cleaver thought through and I was so impressed about the vivid writing of them. I’m still haunted by the wold/bear like creatures with the tributes eyes and I loved the mocking jays and their singing talents but also the trackerjackers. And who in their right mind can make me fall in love with a book about child murder.. Just the way the words are written about the world suggests that the writer thinks this is not okay and that was one of the things I love most about this book and that really made me laugh.
  Main Character (5,0 stars) 
 “Katniss, the girl who was on fire!” Katniss is and will always be one of my favorite character. She is a bit cynical, but also super badass. She makes right decisions always knows what to do, keeps her head clear, protects who she loves. I’m still so impressed with how flawed Collins can make a character and also made me love her from the first sentence. I love how much Katniss doubts about her and Peeta in this book though the reader can see it is genuine. I also loved in this book that the girl is the protector and the provider and she is in no way dependent on Peeta.
  Other characters (5,0 stars) 
 Like I said before I would have liked to know more about the other tributes. But this is only because I seriously love all the others. Every character whether they were a villain or a hero was perfect in character. I’m so obsessed with the career tributes; how can a person be willing to risk their life like this willingly. I’m so curious about the situations in district 1 through 6 (I don’t believe we get to hear anything from them in the next books). I absolutely love how the careers are this evil villains that train their whole life. I’m so in love with Rue and Prim they are both adorable, I found the bond that Katniss forms with the girls really realistic. I also found Haymitch and Effy super realistic. They are both in their own way super unique personalities I’ve never come across in a book. I love that they both deal with their feelings in their own way and I also really like the character development the both of them make. I also really like the characters from the capitol. I think the people are put down so haughtily and naive that you kind of feel sorry for them even though they are one of the reasons the hunger games still continues. And of course Cinna, what a hero, one of my favorite characters in this book. Peeta is just amazing, I loved how supportive he is of Katniss. 
  Romance (5,0 stars) 
 “Remember, we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.” Like so many, I’m not a fan of love triangles. And I skipped over most off the parts where Katniss compares Gale and Peeta, although I must admit this aren’t much. I loved to slowly experience Katniss fall in love with Peeta, even when she’s not realizing it. And that is one of the things I love most about this book, the realistically falling in love.
  Plot (5,0 stars) 
This plot, it never stops, never halts, never slows and certainly never bores. Every single aspect about this book is so thought through and cleverly designed that there just isn’t a flaw to detect. I loved the political aspect that’s woven in this series, the tactics that behind picking a ‘simple’ dress was so awesome to read. I loved the involvement of clothing in this book so much, it adds so much more dimension and reality and shows the differences between districts and capitol so well. I loved to read about what Cinna designs and creates and found it so clever of Collins to also add these dimensions (only thing again was that I missed some more costume descriptions of all the other tributes). I enjoyed this plot so so much and I realized that I had forgotten some details that aren’t in the movie. The thing about the muttations their eyes, gave me goosbumps all over again. And also the story line from the Avox girl! I also LOVE the including of some really original aspects that are going to be associated with the Hunger Games forever. Like the three fingers in the air kiss and the mockingjay symbol.The only thing that was kind of a shame, and that is done pretty good in the movie, is to enlighten the motives of the capitol and game makers a bit more. The decisions behind some things are a bit vague and in the movie it shows really clear what happens everywhere in the arena and capitol. I for example have no clue how Thresh died and I wanted so much more to know about the bloody opening battle and I found it a missed opportunity to not include this. Some favorite scenes:-	Katniss volunteering (still tearing up with this)-	Katniss her dress-	Katniss scoring her 11-	The interviews-	The opening from the hunger games -	Rue O Rue:([image error]-	Katniss finding Peeta near the water-	Katniss dropping the nest on the carreers-	Being chased by the wolf/bear like muttants-	The final scene with the berries
  The ending (5,0 stars) 
This ending has so much tension and though it concludes this book it urges you to keep on reading. The way Katniss plays the capitol is absolutely amazing and I love how she outsmarted them. I also really like that the last interview got included in this one and that Peeta’s leg shows that not everything can be healed. I’m looking forward to re-reading the other books! “You don’t forget the face of the person who was your last hope.”","Jul 26, 2014"

Also, the trend of dystopian young adult novels hadn't really ramped up yet (the trend didn't catch on with The Giver back in the 90s).I really got into this book and couldn't put it down. I know at least two people who had never heard of it that read it right way after my recommendation (can you believe that, a time when someone had not heard of The Hunger Games!?!).Needless to say, even if dystopian YA is super saturated now or you are suffering from Hunger Games fatigue, this was a pretty good book!","Jan 08, 2013"
"9780439023481","3978225","Carol.","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol","Everyone's reviewed The Hunger Games. It's time someone reviewed the setting, specifically, mine.*I take the book and head to my bed, attempting to worm my way in between the edge and my dog, who is grumpy and doesn't want to be disturbed. I'm left with about eighteen inches of blanket between him and the edge of the covers, so I draw a throw over the exposed parts and start reading. I soon find myself lost in imagining the hardscrabble life of District 12 and wondering if the 'meat-eaters' Katniss refers to outside the fence mean zombies. I hope so, but I'm doubtful, because otherwise the reviews would have mentioned zombies. Most reviewers don't just forget to mention something like that in a review if the book has them. Like vampires, they are hard to ignore. So she probably means cougars and such. Oh well. Still, note to self: look out for 'meat eaters.'Katniss' has just the sort of self-reliance and composure I love to see in a character. I understand her anger at her mother, although I sigh a little at yet another female who has an Oedipus complex. I am glad that Prim is used to humanize her, even if it is a tried and true technique. I find myself interested in Buttercup, the antagonistic, ill-named cat. Still, my own canine Buttercup isn't budging, despite my attempts to gradually use my leg as a wedge to drive him further toward the middle of the bed. I'm getting colder, since the throw isn't compensating for the house cooling. Since it is late and I'm cold, I decide a hot bath would be just the setting for the next stage of the journey.Alas, while the water is satisfactorily warm to start with, it never reaches the truly steaming temperature that is worth a prolonged soak. I try to read quickly. Leaving the District, headed toward the Capitol, and the wider world in this post-apocalypic setting is becoming clear, as well as Collins starting to detail revolutionary underpinnings. Still, it's subtle, and I rather like that in a book, especially a teen one. The city setting is unsurprising, although it seems like quite a tech contrast from the districts, and the connection Katniss develops with the understated stylist Cinna is warming. I wonder if he is supposed to be referencing a real-world designer? Except all the ones I've heard of seem quite flamboyant. I wonder if Collins is trying to say something about character in the city? It is here, immersed in rapidly cooling water that I wonder a bit if I'm reading too fast, because I find myself hitting more areas that I don't think Collins explained and I find it a little odd when Katniss suddenly drops these bits of knowledge for the reader. Except why does she seem clueless at times? But despite running more water, the bathwater isn't getting much warmer, so I can't be bothered to go back and re-read to see if I missed some subtle hint. I'm a little irritated from being chilled, so it's time to get out before I start picking further at the story.Changed into pajamas, dogs sprawled on the bed but with a spare third left for me. I weasel my way under the covers and nudge a dog aside. The contestants have entered the arena, poised in their metal circles. The writing is done well enough to give a sense of place and yet pull action forward. The firewall unleashed by the gamemasters seems a bit unfair and reminds me of (insert any reality show here) but it reminds me I have a heating pad in the bed, so I turn it on to warm me up faster. The action in the arena is captivating, and is isn't until Katniss is hallucinating that I realize I am also experiencing a bit of double-vision. My new bookshelf arrived yesterday, and it didn't get more than a day to air out before I impatiently hauled it inside, spending a number of happy hours rearranging my books. Unfortunately, it had been so tightly wrapped that the stain hadn't really finished out-gassing, and I was starting to get headachey. As Katniss tried to recover, I decided timing was right for my own move. Besides, I knew she would survive--it's a trilogy. I turned on the ceiling fan and headed to the living room where there was a nice thick comforter and couch just waiting for me.Wrapped up in the comforter, I prepared to finish the book. I liked the way Collins gradually brought about Katniss' political awakening. Using Rue was a particularly smart move that helped it feel organic with character and story. No zombies--I don't think, although that appears to be a question for another time. I certainly understand complaints about the nature of the games and how Collins wrote herself a number of very easy ways out of a truly ethically ambiguous situation, and I confess that goes against my story preference. I find myself agreeing with Jocelyn's emphasis on the story as a fairy tale. Still, in that context, it was enjoyable and well-paced, if not riveting. And, after all, I was finally warm, snug in the feather comforter with only hands and head exposed.

Should I agree with all the sheep in my generation and say that The Hunger Games is ""a beautiful, dark world and a vision of a realistic dystopian future and a wonderful teen series"", or should I tell the truth?Well, I can't repeat all the swearing I have racing through my mind when I think back to what I read, but I can say it absolutely sucked. It was depressing, not in a way that makes you intellectually stimulated and thinking about the world around you, but depressing in that somewhere some lady is filthy-rich off of a book series that is boring, overrated and unoriginal. Reading about the main characters was like reading a really sloppy, bad anime with nothing original, all flash and no substance. The main character is annoying, I pictured her as being incredibly ugly too from the given descriptions of her, and she's clad with a dorky bow-and-arrow with a goofy braid in her hair. Nothing makes the characters stand out at all, they're flat, boring and have nothing you can enjoy or sympathize with. Katniss herself is lazy, boring, superficial and self-absorbed.I don't really care about the amount of violence; I've read and watched so much worse and if the author was trying to make some sort of point by just having death as a quick, straightforward solution to all problems, well that's just disturbing and I wonder why she wasn't questioned about that.I HATE THE NAME KATNISS! I don't know why, it's just childish and grating to think about, it's like a word a two-year-old makes up.I don't understand why people think this series is so wonderful, if it was trying to raise a point about society it didn't do a very good job. I'm going to leave now and try and get my mental coherence back by reading books that are actually good. The Ice Storm by Rick Moody and 1984 by George Orwell, I'll start with those and hope I can forget reading The Hunger Games forever.","Nov 19, 2014"

  Book Review:Even my eyes are just too heavy and I really wanted to sleep, I can't resist myself to read the book from start to finish just so I can know how it end. Entertaining and thrilling, I cannot put it down!I guess the not so good thing about it is that it's like a rip-off from battle royale. Though I think the love story in it is much better, the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. Its like I'm torn like Katniss to whom I love more Peeta or Gale. The games (chapter 2) is my favorite. The fight for survival, not only that the other tributes are your enemy, but it also you against the hunger, thirst, the game makers and vicious creatures. How Katniss survives because of her hunting abilities and that Rue allied with her. It's detailed, the herbs, the hunting for food, the weapons and that's make it more realistic for me. It also has plot twists that I never see coming. It has drama, action, romance and comedy so I think it will appeal to a lot of readers out there. It also has a depth in it because it's a story about human versus society. PS:Hey I have written a fan-fic and you've got to read it: Peeta Mellark in Real Life","Jul 10, 2009"

He chuckled at my characteristic inability to stop reading for the whole trip, and when I started gushing about this book (which I couldn’t even put down long enough to snarf one of those melty chocolate lava cakes that they have) he was all, “blah blah, it sounds weird, whatever.”Let me just explain that my husband loves to read nonfiction of the science and political sort primarily, with the occasional nerdy sci-fi or fantasy thrown in. His books have titles that reflect the degree to which various people believe this Earth is going to hell in a hand basket. I completely agree with this, but I don’t particularly like reading about it because I get too depressed. I think that he assumed this book would be too young or too fluffy, and he had no intention of ever picking it up.However, I had a plan.Two and half years ago I recommended this book to his brother, who promptly read it and then consumed the following books as they were released.Two years ago his sister, following his brother’s lead, picked up these books and became just as hooked.One year ago, when Mockingjay came out, I had a few gushing type conversations about this series within my husband’s audible range.Six months ago, both his brother and his sister asked for hardback copies of this series for Christmas, and as the family’s drug book dealer I had to be the one to get them.About two weeks ago, he picked this book out of my bookshelf and casually mentioned that he might give it a go.Yesterday at around 1:00 PM he picked it up.At 7:00 PM, he said (out loud, which is highly uncharacteristic), “god, that’s depressing.”At 10:00 PM I remarked that he had been reading for quite some time and that he might even finish it today. To which he replied, “Oh…no, I can’t read that fast. I have other things that I want to do tonight.”At 11:30 PM I went to bed, leaving him on the couch, still reading.At 1:30 AM We were both awakened for a middle of the night potty break with our three year old. When I got back in bed, he says, all casually, “Yeah, so…I finished that book.”“And?”“Mmmm…it was okay.”“…”“So…uh…do you have the next one?”GOT YOU TOM!!

  “You have a...remarkable memory.""""I remember everything about you. You're the one who wasn't paying attention.”
Soooo...I said I wasn't going to write a long-winded review that tarnished the simplistic, yet epic, nature of my all time favorite series. And I don't plan to-REALLY. But right before I started to get deep into GR, I found this wonderful piece of literature that stole my heart and I never really got to express how it changed my life. And I think it deserves at least a few words for that. 
  I don't want to lose the boy with the bread.

  I have always been a reader-even as a little girl I could hole up in my room with the best of them if I needed to finish an (even then I knew) epic book. But I was always active in sports, encouraged to balance my time, to not be a total recluse-And I will always thank my parents for that. But now that I am older and can read before bed as I please with my own bank account to manage, I find that I read more than I even watch tv or even shop-which I also love doing. 
  Then he smiles as if he'd be happy to lie there and gaze at me forever.
But for a while, life was more important-Sports, schoolwork, getting into college, finding my now husband.....and while I read, it was more like the common population was. I got to read, but didn't get to flourish. And then my best friend (ex Best Friend now) in college MADE me read THG. My argument was, 'Why in the hell would I want to read about a bunch of kids killing each other?' The barbarics of it astounded me and the inhumanity it must have taken to write it (or so I thought) appalled me. But then I picked it up-begrudgingly-and my world was flipped on it's axis. Nothing has ever been the same. I read this series in a week-two or three days, to be exact-and I couldn't be bothered with life, my husband, or ANYONE. And then, because it literally consumed my soul, I read it two weeks later-in full-again. I. Could. Not. Think. About. Anything else. Because how could a book about the MURDER of children be this good?? 
  ""Stay Alive.""

  But that's where I was one hundred percent wrong. This book is so much deeper than death-it's about life, it's about doing everything you can to survive, to save your family and those you care about. It's about love and compassion and the question of humanity and what you are willing to do to survive and keep those you care about out of harm's way. It's about a spark. A revolution. A girl on fire that no one saw coming....Katniss fucking Everdeen.
  
  “No. Now, shut up and eat your pears.”
This book, even after having read it three times, was just as good as in 2012. I still laughed. I still cried. I still couldn't breathe. The feels haven't went anywhere and there are still scenes that the movie couldn't capture or touch with a ten foot pole (Even though I do love the movies). The cave scene. The creek scene. The 'hunting as a pair' scene. Even the end couldn't hold as much weight as the book. And for those of you who have only seen the movies, yeah, it's amazing. Best book to movie adaption ever, in my opinion (all of them thus far, especially 2). But...I can't help feeling sorry for you. You will never know the deep attachments that were formed and just how much depth there is to such a simple story. And...sorry. I feel sorry for you. So, no, I couldn't not write something, because this series is everything to me and why I read like a lunatic now, always looking for my next fix that will make me feel like this again. I don't know if it's possible...but I'm up for the challenge.

And you've probably already read all of what I have to say before, but I've decided to write this review anyway. The first person view really allows the reader to connect to Katniss as a character, which I think is really well done. It's great to read that she doesn't always have all the answers, and her flaws make her a much more interesting character. She has just the right amount of emotion, not too soppy and not like a robot. Every single character in the novel was well developed and completely unique. Even minor characters such as the stylists were described well and distinguished between, which was exceptionally done. There are always people to provide humour, or a voice of reason when it's needed and the personalities were well balanced. I really loved the settings. District 12, the capitol and the arena are all brilliantly unique and fit well with the storyline. My main issue (really only minor) was that I thought sometimes the descriptions were unclear. I would have the setting pictured one way in my head, but suddenly there would be a pond that I would have to factor in which I couldn't recall. I never really understood the size of the arena, and whilst the settings were magnificent, I wish there were more descriptions of them to show off what wonderful surroundings Collins had invented. I don't think there were any really crazy plot twists, but I was still on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what happened next. Even though I've now read it multiple times, I still eagerly anticipate every page. I won't spoil it, but the book was concluded satisfactorily so that you're not dying whilst you wait (if you have to) for the next one, but it also leaves many plot points for the next book. The sequel is very well set up. I really loved this book. It was excellently written with a great plot and great characters.

Well written, with excellent world-building, an engaging main character and a terrific plot. It is tough to do a dystopian world well, especially in a YA setting, and the author does a superb job in making the background dark enough to grab you by the throat without letting it completely overwhelm the narrative. After finishing the book, I was defintely left with the desire to learn more about the world and the characters. Just what you want at the beginning of a trilogy.

When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about. When I wasn't thinking about it I was asleep. Even then the book crept into my mind at times.  At the beginning I was very hesitant to finish the book. Not because I didn't like it, but because it's part of a series. This one being the only one out at the moment. My sister warned me that the end is a bit of a cliffhanger, and I was sure that I'd be ripping my hairs out wanting to know how the series ended NOW! It's worth it though. The premise of the book made me dubious at first also. I mean, kids who are forced to kill each other until there's only one left standing doesn't sound like a nice read. The gore wasn't half as bad as I'd anticipated (maybe because I used to watch crime shows). All the characters had so much depth that while you're reading it feels like they're completely real. As I read in another review, Katniss is both strong and resourceful, but naive at the same time. Katniss' feelings were so palpable that it was like the book actually had a heart beat. It could be that I could understand her feelings because I have siblings, but there is absolutely nothing else in which I could relate to Katniss, so I believe it's the writing that captures her voice and feelings so well. Obviously I'm planning on reading the rest of the series.  I don't want to give too much away, but the only reason why I knocked off a half star was because I wished Katniss would've seen what I thought was obvious. Also, I HATE love triangles (this is usually a deal-breaker for me). Nothing good comes of love triangles. Why do people do this? WHY?!? It also peeved me how it played out in the end, but I guess if it all worked out perfect then there would be no need to read the other books. I'm hooked.","May 14, 2009"

"9780439023481","6313408","Jonathan Terrington","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6313408-jonathan-terrington","First ReviewI believe the time has come for me to construct a proper review of this work. I'll be honest and admit that the brilliant film inspired me to do so. I'm not ashamed of the fact that I'm a bibliophile and love a good movie adaptation. So hang onto your hats as I explain why I love The Hunger Games series... My personal opinion as mentioned before is that there is always something special about the first novel in any series. No matter how trashy it may appear. And if I see that glimmer I will read on and see if things improve in the later books. Fortunately things did not need to improve as this magical work was brilliant on its own. I think part of the appeal of The Hunger Games is the fact that Suzanne Collins made some smart decisions in the plot twists and developments of her world. the choice to narrate the story in first person and reveal the reality that Katniss faces in the games. The way in which she drew me in as a reader with the preparations for the games and then the games itself was astounding. The final decision made by the characters I could only partially see coming. (view spoiler)[I thought that the berries would be used again but I sort of thought as a way of killing another contestant. Admittedly that part at the end was a little rushed in the book. (hide spoiler)]I must state that when it comes to the use of present tense I liked it in the novel. I hate (unless it's meant to be a journal) reading first person narratives in past tense. It just makes me go: how the hell did you remember all that dialogue? Speaking of dialogue some have mentioned they found the dialogue one dimensional. I personally never noticed this but then again I have only read the books once. I'm going to have to get myself a copy of these books. They are definitely one of my favourite young adult series I've read. And I've read a few. Yes obtaining the series and then re-reading is definitely on the cards.While this may not be the best written series ever - although it is very well written on the whole - for can any book really challenge for being the best written work? It has heart and soul and as a reader it really draws you in. And I think that the enjoyment you gain from any book and the memories you take away are the most important things.So as you've no doubt guessed I along with over 90 percent of goodreaders recommend this book and if you haven't read it and are an active goodreader where have you been? Just a question out of interest. I also highly recommend the incredible film which in my view is a pretty decent adaptation.Second ReviewThe Hunger Games is actually a really smart political statement about our media dominated world. Why did I not see this before? Although I guess that makes it a sort of ironic statement since it is being published through media outlets and is making money from people's enjoyment of the violent Hunger Games inside it...Either way I love the whole idea of how there is this world dominated by a dictator who controls the masses through showing them his power in how he can force their young children to destroy one another. We as individuals may think that we are immune to the postulations of the media but think honestly and tell me that you've never blindly accepted a statement. Have you looked into the proper scientific backing of evolution and climate change; have you analysed the motived behind the various wars and ideologies shoved in our faces via the news; and have you ever looked into the controversial topics such as euthanasia or abortion? Or do you prefer to sit and listen to the 'even handed' coverage of the media. Which to be frank is not controlled by the reporters but by the wealthy executives who have...shock and horror...agendas.And that is what The Hunger Games portrays. A world where the wealthy prosper (they can enjoy the sadistic cruelty of the games like the Romans - and how we enjoy fictionalised violence to greater extents) and the poor are forced to hear history from their perspective. A world where rebellion is crushed by the forced execution of teenagers by teenagers. Children whose only crime is to not belong to the rich. I personally think that it's an interesting idea and one which is also entertainingly written. There are mythical motifs and interesting characters which help make the story interesting but at the end of the day it's a smart YA novel that deals sensitively with its material without being afraid to throw a few punches.","Sep 15, 2011"

Perhaps it was good for me to see one example of what bestsellers look like (bland, poorly-edited, conveniently plotted, cliche), but I see no reason to prove it to myself all over again.Based on what I've heard from clever folks, Hunger Games blandly avoids its own premise, is about as dystopian as The Giver (which is to say, not at all), and is insidiously antifeminist (though dressed up in the guise of empowerment).Some people do want me to read this because they enjoy when I make fun of terrible books, but I can guarantee that I'll find plenty of terrible books out there without actively seeking them out.

"9780439023481","5645967","Laurel","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5645967-laurel","**FAIR WARNING THIS IS DIVING INTO THE OTHER BOOKS AS WELL***SPOILERS*This may just become a series review...I don’t wanna get to that but it’s probably happening.While reading this first installment a second time through, I received a text from my older brother, who recently graduated from Penn State University.His text merely said, “Bring home the Hunger Games please”. My brother doesn’t care much about reading unless the stories involves Marvel, DC, or Harry Potter, so I was surprised to say the least. I’m assuming through his girlfriend, who is awesome, and from seeing the amazing Hunger Games trailer, he has a need to read these books.Side note: As an avid moviegoer, I am in love with that trailer and its music, I’m going to the midnight premiere no matter what because movies are fabulous and I won’t let my lukewarm views on Hunger Games destroy my movie experience. Also, Gary fucking Ross. I don’t doubt his directing for a second.Of course I plan to oblige my brother and bring the whole trilogy down from school, and he’ll probably sit back and say, “That was nuts!” or something like that. I sit in conflict about that reaction though, because this book is really not that impressive. And I am dead serious about that. I don’t see the Changes-My-Life-Will-Have appeal about this book. It isn’t there. Ohhhh this is going to be a fucking hard review.My original thoughts on this book still stand, and some new faults have come along the way. When I originally read this book, I thoroughly enjoyed it, but there were some areas that just didn’t make any sense to me, like why it had to last more than one book, and why the ending seemed so silly. Now, there’s more that I can talk about that seems to irk me.We all know the debate with Hunger Games and Battle Royale, and I can’t compare the two because I have not read Battle Royale/watched the movie/read the manga (I know, I should do all three). I do know the basics though and I honestly can’t attack Collins on that matter. I think she had no idea that there was another book like hers and just drove into her imagination.By all means, thanks for trying, Collins, but c’mon, research is important. You gotta know that no other book has your storyline. It obviously strays enough to stay original but you get my point.The Hunger Games follows the story of Katniss Everdeen, tough gal and huntress who is the only real working member of her family. Her mom’s a dingus, and her sister is innocent and precious and isn’t developed to be anything more so. She volunteers to go to the Hunger Games in place of her cutesy sister, and violence, whether it’s necessary or not, ensues.Let’s dive into some break down:We all can’t avoid this: there is some great writing here. Outside the fashion descriptions that made me cringe - I don’t know why they do, but I just can’t stand them. Seriously, every time Katniss twirled her glitz gown or talked about the sparkles like flames, I imagined Joel McHale and his Rainbow Brite heroine display.Twirl for me, Joel...HOWEVER, I really like the choppiness of Katniss’s voice. I’m glad to see that she actually HAS a voice. Granted it’s too serious roughly 104% of the time, it’s there and it’s there to stay. It’s nice and clean and does a good job in the more violent areas in the book. However, in the slower areas, like that whole first third, it didn’t shine. It seemed way out of place and made the pacing very awkward. When the action stated, I felt bombarded with intense shit and tried to figure out where the hell everyone was going because I was so in the rut of “Fashion! Capitol! Food!”.Also, knowing common terminology would be nice, Collins. You have a nest of tracker jackers down, a pack of wolf muttations, you SHOULD KNOW that a QUIVER holds arrows. Sheaths hold blades. And only blades. This is a minor thing though, so don’t worry too much about that.Collins world-building skills also need a little help.We get a bit of how Panem came to be: famine, rising sea level, blah blah blah, but if you’re diving into that, how about our world? How did we crumble? Asteroid? Nuclear war? What about Europe? Asia? “Oh no one knows derp.” COME ON. If you’re bothering to remake a government structure as whacked as Panem, and let’s face it, a President controlling arbitrary Districts across a country by means of child brawls is pretty out there, then we need to dive deeper than simply what happened to the thirteenth district 74 years prior to the story’s opening.Besides the backstory that almost was, I still enjoyed the development of District 12. It was a good start and brought me into Panem even though the rest of the Districts and their descriptions never came to be except for a few. Writing’s still good, but that backstory and pacing is just jarring. That’s what I get from my second read through of The Hunger Games.The Hunger Games. It’s only one game, and it’s not even a game. Why is this plural if it’s just one death match in one arena? Anyone got a good answer for that? Cause I sure as hell don’t. Sorry, I’m just thinking out loud.Moving on to the characters, I noticed something really funny about this entire series, and it unveils a HUGE fault in Collins’ writing.Counting out Katniss, and Peeta a little bit, no one changes in this series. No one. There are no massive obstacles for people like Gale, Finnick, Prim, and Haymitch. They don’t have character arcs, they’re just lines. Looking at Gale and how amazing he is, I realize that he’s...still hating on the Capitol all the way through Mockingjay, to the very end.Now Gale is one of my favorite characters because he has reasonable thoughts. I understand his hatred, but it’d be a good arc if say, he blew up that Nut in Mockingjay, realize just how many people he killed, felt TERRIBLE afterward, then decided that it wasn’t worth going to battle to stop Snow or whatever. That’d make for a better development of character. Also, he only exists for about 40 pages in this book...why the fuck is he even in this again?Same goes for Prim. Prim is still sweet and innocent and not a fighter all the way through the series. She still doesn’t develop enough for me to care about her in Mockingjay, but I was happy to see that she at least went into medical training. It was a start that...gave her an excuse to be on the front lines and die there.Haymitch shows promise of change and then, nope, it doesn’t get to happen. He stays a drunk forever. I can’t even...balls.Katniss has her change, but it isn’t even a good change. This is referring to a difference that WORKS for the character. She’s tough and hard and handles herself, but then, when she loses Prim, she doesn’t want to live anymore, she’s helpless. This is Katniss’ shining moment! This is to prove how strong of a character she can be!And it flops. Hard. Katniss never gets out of that rut. It's one thing if you serves justice and then are forever changed, but Katniss just goes Bella Swan and stays in her Victory house or whatever for three months. THREE MONTHS.My anger towards this has no limit. Also, President Snow is the main antag, right? He’s mentioned once on page 366 of this book. “Oh but Cato is the antagonist for this book!” Cool story, bro, but we need that series roadblock. WHERE IS THE SERIES ROADBLOCK. “The Capitol derp!” True, but I wish it was more that just a government. I want the person running it to be more involved. This is why I think the movie Snow is gonna be better than book Snow.Characters I did enjoy: Cinna, Foxface, and Rue. Cinna was the diamond in the rough. He was an awesome sir. I want to catch me a Cinna. Rue, though existing for a short while, develops like a wildfire, as does Foxface when she’s mentioned. Ohhh I want to be Foxface. Even though her death was as anti-climactic and lame as Thresh’s. It was just an excuse to get to Cato as the ‘final’ boss or whatever.Now we all have the “war is baaaad!” message going on, but looking back in the first Hunger Games book, this message doesn’t exist. It’s not even THERE. In fact, there isn’t even the hint of change present in the book’s end! The climax didn’t help propel a problem into the next book. There’s no thought of, “You know, we should stop this whole thing.” It’s just, “Hey, we won the Hunger Games! Let’s go on home! YEAH HOME!”I have to laugh at that too, because the other Districts of Panem start relying on these two teenagers like they could single-handedly stop everything and save the world. The Earth will stop rotating and the universe will stop expanding and watch KatPee in all its glory. The star-crossed lovers will define a country! ONCE A-FUCKING-GAIN, romance prevails in a book about survival. Can we not? Please? Ever since Harry Potter, everything has been about fucking romance over the actual plot. Actually, that’s false, Blood Red Road didn’t suffer that trauma. THANK FUCKING GOD.WAIT.IT GETS BETTER.WE NEED A LOVE TRIANGLE.Fuck everything to hell. WHY are they so important? The romance feels incredibly forced anyhow! Why do this to your readers?Frankly, I’d enjoy myself it this book was about the hell that was the Capitol rule and not these blubbering Hunger Games and the dumb, unnecessary love triangle. Give me a state of mayhem and havoc and you got me more hooked. Seriously, that’d develop the world so much more and we’d get more Gale. Sorry, I just like Gale too much.I’m trying to recall the structure in this book. We know the beginning climax is Katniss saying, “FUCK I VOLUNTEER.” But what about the middle climax? Is that...the whole game? I’d say Rue's death, even though she lasted for about 150 pages total (and yet she got more closure than Finnick, Gale, and Haymitch fucking COMBINED. HOW THE FUCK DO YOU DO THAT). Final climax? I guess it’d be the face-off with Cato, but that seemed anti-climactic to me. Like, we keep hearing about Cato and seeing his fury, but we never get the full extent of if because those fucking weird, and silly, wolf muttations.But frankly, all the hell that was rampaging through the Games and the GODDAMN CLIFFHANGERS got me too aggravated to really care. Wanna know just how many of these chapters ended in cliffhangers?13 out of 27.I’m sorry, but I can’t handle that many. It doesn’t spook me, freak me out, or get me to say “HOLY SHIT” and read further. Having about...three would do that, but when almost HALF OF YOUR BOOK ends in cliffhangers, something is wrong. That’s your pacing being silly. You’re trying too hard. Stop. Really. STOP OVERKILLING THE ‘DUN DUN DUN’s.Even though this book irked me, I still enjoyed myself. I still cheered on Katniss and her determination. She grew on me enough to like her strengths and flaws. The Hunger Games is most certainly better than the snot/shit/dumb stuff that’s coming out and rampaging over the bookshelves. Collins is at least trying. And I do give her props because writing a book is fucking hard. And writing a negative review to someone’s hard work is fucking hard, especially when I still enjoyed the book a decent amount of the time.It does hurt me to tear into this book, but I can’t handle the fact that while the message may be nice, it’s a literary mess. Series character arcs don’t exist, series climax doesn’t exist, craptastic world-building, awkward pacing, closure fails all around, you get my point.I’d say you all should read Blood Red Road. Saba is better than Katniss by far, and the book itself is thoroughly entertaining in its style. Also the pacing is like...picture perfect.Enough praising some other book. If you haven’t read Hunger Games, you might as well. The movie’s comin’ out in March so hurray! Time to start Catching Fire? HA, maybe when my brother’s done with the series.Either way, I never want to touch Mockingjay again.Ever.","Jun 16, 2011"

I am ridiculously protective of my books and the characters that come to life through them. Film adaptations always make me nervous because empirical data suggests a high rate of illiteracy amongst Hollywood executives. When I found out The Hunger Games, or MY FAVORITE SERIES, was getting adapted to the big screen, I put on my aviator cap and goggles and started hovering. I had already mentally cast my Katniss, Peeta, Gale, Haymitch, and Cinna, so I was obsessed with any and all casting news and how the real cast matched up to my mental cast. Aside from Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, EVERYONE else made me nervous. Miley Cyrus's boyfriend? Gale would never! Woody Harrelson?? Haymitch is a drunk, not a stoner! Josh Hutcherson? His name is longer than he is! Lenny Kravitz? Being married to Denise Huxtable does not an actor make! I analyzed every trailer and tried to tamp down my expectations. I decided to re-read the books instead so the story would be fresh in my mind for the premiere -- because obviously I was going to a midnight showing.I really liked the movie, but the standouts were undoubtedly Katniss, Cinna, Rue, and Prim. Those actors nailed their roles. They exceeded every expectation and brought these characters to life as Suzanne Collins wrote. Lenny Kravitz WAS Cinna. Rue and Prim were even more impressive, not only because they're so young, but also because they're the emotional centers -- Prim is Katniss's heart in District 12 and Rue is Katniss's heart in the Arena. Amandla Stenberg and Willow Shields had more of a performance burden on them than, say, Liam Hemsworth because if they didn't deliver, it would've undermined Katniss's journey. At least, that's how I saw it. But those girls, those actors, delivered. I had to stop myself from bawling at the Reaping and bawling during that scene in the Games. I can't even imagine the emotional and professional high those girls feel right now, knowing all the pressure that was on them from crazy helicopter fans like myself.And then I saw the article on Jezebel. Disgusted doesn't even cover it. Pissed isn't strong enough. When I saw Amandla Stenberg's tweet, ""#spreadlove"", I just got so sad that this 13, THIRTEEN year old girl had to be subject to this when she should be ecstatic. Since I don't condone meeting stupidity and ignorance with violence, let's have a chat. People who don't agree with Amandla Stenberg's casting but claim to be fans of the book: let's talk reader to reader. WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU READ?? What part of ""dark brown skin"" is difficult to understand, imagine, and see? I'm truly flummoxed.

I honestly don't know how I let so much time pass in between readings of this book. I was actually pretty reluctant to read this one again, given the current political situation. Plus, my reading expectations have changed a lot in the last almost-FIVE-YEARS WHAT THE EFF, so I honestly wasn't sure if I'd still see it as a five star book. Fortunately, I do. Reading this five years on, the politics stands out to me so much more than it ever did. Cinna's manipulation of the system. Haymitch's fierce determination to make Katniss a symbol. Katniss' recognition of how sick it is that the people on her makeover team reminisce fondly about where they were at particular moments when various tributes died. Rue's innocent discussion of life in District 11. It's SUCH a political book, and it blows me away how sneakily the politics is woven into the story throughout. So yeah. It's still a five star book. 18/1/2012I decided I needed to reread this in the lead up to the film being released. And I'm very glad I did. I got so much more from it than I did the first time around, when it was mostly just ""OMG, HAVE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, READ FASTER!!"". Without giving away any details, there were numerous moments when I just wanted to shake Katniss and tell her to LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING PROPERLY. It sometimes seemed like she was standing back from it all, watching someone else walk around in her body. And there were numerous moments when it seemed like everyone but her had some kind of ability to see the future, and knew what she was going to become. I'll be interested to see if they include that sense in the film. 2/10/2011I was slightly sceptical about this, given that everyone was raving about it. The last time that happened, it was over the Twilight series, which is one of the worst pieces of crap I've ever had the misfortune to read. This, on the other hand, I really enjoyed. And am now very much looking forward to the movie coming out! I'll definitely have to track down the other books in the series, because I really want to know what happens next.","Sep 30, 2011"
"9780439023481","4268487","Dustin","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4268487-dustin"," A few years ago, I saw the film adaptation of The Hunger Games, and disliked it very much. The ending, especially. Not only is it a cop-out, I think its cheapens its potential. Needless to say, this didn't compel me to rush out to the local book store or library any time soon. And it was with extreme reluctance that I finally gave the novel a shot. I'm glad I did.Suzanne Collins's dystopian, YA tale is about much more than its engaging and highly addictive plot. It's merely the beginning of Katniss Everdeen's journey of self-discovery, of love, the consequences of her actions and by the end, I want to think she's on the verge of questioning why she makes the choices that she does. I'm still not sure that I like her, as I have no clear sense of who she is, on a personal level. I do admire some of her qualities, I even sympathize and can relate to her...to a degree. I just want to know more, I want to delve deep into her psyche, analyzing and then basking in her memories, both benign, indifferent, and malevolent. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but these are some of things I look for while reading. I need to know the character's intimately, and to watch them mature and grow. And she does, to a point, but I feel a disconnect between her actions and words. To quote the incomparable George R.R. Martin, ""Words are wind."" Actions are everything, and hers show a weakness in some ways, and strength in others. She's too temperamental. But more than that, I fell in love with the history of Panem. For that reason alone, I don't regret reading this. After all, there are many gems not seen in the film, like the significance of the mockingjay, and the tender associations that Katniss associates with it and her father. The history fascinated me. I'm really hoping to learn more as the trilogy progresses. In all earnestness, Collins could write am entire novel-length book depicting the details of the country's uprise, the rebellion (view spoiler)[that led to the Games and its origin, (hide spoiler)] and all it entails, and I'd probably love it.  She writes of an oppressed society where stealing is punishable by death and suicide's almost a virtue. Of finding yourself and one's self-worth in this ever changing and complex world. Ultimately, it's about all these things, and more. Refuse to stay silent. Defy your oppressor.  There are a few passages which really resonate, like the ""bread scene."" The following awed me, and could potentially be the inspiration of a story, assuming I choose to pursue something similar:
  ""..'A field. As far as you can see it's full of grasses as high as my shoulders. I don't know, maybe some of them are grain. There are patches of different colors. But there are no paths...It has a sinister feeling to it. Every time I look at that field, all I can think of are hidden things. Snakes, and rabid animals, and quicksand.. There could be anything in there."" '
 It's writing like this that leads me to believe that The Hunger Games could have been better. And suspect much more from her in the future. If she had polished this manuscript a bit more, complete with the omission of needless words, including all those annying cliche's, with an emphasis on clarity, I believe she could have transformed it from good to great. 
  ""Their eyes were the least of my worries. What about their brains? Have they been given any of the real tributes memories? Have they been programmed to hate our faces particularly because we have survived and they were so callously murdered? And the ones we actually killed.. do they believe they're avenging their own deaths?""
 Although the basis premise of her trilogy isn't original (reminiscent of The Running Man,) I appreciate the fact that Collins explores the effects of war, and the increasingly violent realities of television. So-called ""Reality Tv"" especially. It's scary to think about the world reveling in death as entertainment, but isn't that we're doing? Not to the extent seen here or in King's novella, but look at how explicit television shows have become, and we-as a viewing audience-- allow them to thrive. The media sells death on a daily basis, as well as all forms of negativity, and we're all too happy to oblige. The ending. I now understand and appreciate the reasons behind it, but I don't have to like it. I still hate it, and I doubt I'll ever like it. Worse yet, the novel goes another thirty pages after the Games denouement, making it anti-climatic, and not a whole lot was gained.  I have it on good authority (thanks again, Book-sister) that things pick up in the second book, that the crap starts to hit the fan, so I'll give Catching Fire a reluctant go..eventually.","Dec 28, 2011"

But I'm grateful to be still enjoying The Hunger Games. “Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.”If this is your 1st time reading this series, here are few things that you need to know:1. This was written and published in 2008. A decade ago. 2. This has basically started the ""ya-dystopian-genre"" craze! For YA literature at least. Adult genre authors have been writing about things like this for years: Stephen King, William Goulding and George Orwell to name a few. 3. If you are reading a newish dystopian book and you think that Hunger Games took ideas from it - it's probably the other way around (see #1) as after this have been published many authors jumped on the band-wagon of quickly expanding dystopian craze *cough cough* Divergent! *cough* “I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the sun.” Despite few minor inconsistencies, grammar typos and a very, very annoying first person narration - The Hunger Games is a very solid read. I also enjoyed the movies big time (although I'm pretty sure I haven't seen the last one). Although the fact that Gale, who obviously has dark hair, olive skin and dark eyes in the book, ended up a blonde boy with blue eyes in the movie, is beyond infuriating.

Also, perhaps more importantly, I didn't read this book. I listened to the audiobook, which I don't normally do, and I think that probably colored my experience because I was too impatient for the format and the reader's voice was distractingly grating, especially when she tried to approximate male speaking voices.That being said, this book and the two sequels were recommended to me by a close friend whose opinion I respect, and I literally could not believe how bad it was after she told me the series was ""addictive"". I mean, everyone loves this series. I thought it must have some redeeming qualities. I'm still looking.In contrast to other reviewers, I didn't think it was overly violent or graphic. That's kind of the point, and honestly after all the hype I kind of thought it wasn't graphic enough. I was expecting a little more. No, my problems with this book are so numerous and diverse I decided to make a list. (SPOILERS)1. The premise itself was completely unbelievable. Twenty-three children are chosen to die every year, and no one protests because of a group mentality?? Please. The backstory of the District 13 rebellion was slightly interesting, and I think we'll hear more about it in the upcoming books which I will never be reading, but I couldn't buy a universe where parents allowed this to go on. Which leads me to another problem: the completely one-dimensional characters. Katniss and her family and friends good and brave. Peeta's mom selfish and mean. All tributes save Katniss, Peeta and Rue bloodthirsty and primitive. Everyone from the Capitol a buffoon. Etc. Collins' world is just not fully fleshed out. Do the districts have voting rights, and representatives? Why is some technology super advanced, such as genetic engineering, but then transportation seems about the same, and they're still eating most of the same foods as we do today?? This is supposed to be hundreds of years into the future. And yes, I got the US/developing nations dichotomy symbolism. Still doesn't hold-- helicopters and trains would have advanced a lot more if medicine and biology have.2. It's derivative, which I know most modern speculative fiction is, but come on. This was totally Twilight set inside Battle Royale, and yes, the comparisons are deserved. Plus, Effie is exactly Dolores Umbridge. Don't deny it.3. Speaking of denial: be what you are. If you're a teen romance, own it. I feel like the Hunger Games is claiming to be the anti-Twilight because Katniss is supposedly an action hero. Well, she's self involved, kind of a downer, and only acts out of absolute necessity. She's Bella Swan with a bow and arrow. Doesn't make this book any deeper or more feminist than Twilight-type crap.4. Speaking of Katniss? I hate her. I didn't find a single character in this book compelling, but I really hated being saddled with her POV. She's only slightly less of a Mary Sue than Bella, and she's constantly making herself into this martyr. She HAD to buck up and support her family from the age of 12, she had no choice but to hunt in the woods... but then when the gamemakers want to know what she can do, she acts all innocent and incompetent. PLEASE. Plus, I don't believe her relationships with anyone. WHY does she love her sister so much? We barely see them interact. Same with Gale. WHY does Peeta love her? And HOW ON EARTH is anyone so oblivious to multiple boys being in love with her? That's not being uninterested in romance, that's being moronic.5. I really hate being patronized, and I felt like Collins thought her audience was just too dumb to live (which, if they're eagerly reading this series, they may be.) I UNDERSTAND CONNECTIONS/SYMBOLISM. YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN THEM TO ME TIME AND AGAIN. Example:""Unfortunately, the packet of cookies hits the ground and bursts open in a patch of dandelions by the track. I only see the image for a moment, because the train is off again, but it’s enough.""Right, you had told us that you saw a dandelion right after Peeta gave you the bread that enabled you to reclaim your life or whatever. This makes you think of that. Got it.""Enough to remind me of that other dandelion in the school yard years ago…""Yes, we know what dandelion you were thinking of already. There aren't like, multiple significant dandelions in your life. And what's with the ellipses? We're not preparing for a flashback, are we? Oh crap.""I had just turned away from Peeta Mellark's bruised face when I saw the dandelion and I knew hope wasn't lost.""YES WE GET IT STOP EXPLAINING JESUS GOD ALMIGHTY6. This is like, the schmaltziest book ever. Some passages between Katniss and Peeta were so cringe-worthy I almost damaged my ipod. While cringing.7. There's absolutely no suspense because it's told in the 1st person. So pretty much, we know Katniss lives. If I'm supposed to care about anything else, well, I didn't.8. The plot often seemed inconsistent and arbitrary-- the rules change so both Katniss and Peeta can live, then when they take advantage of that, the rules change back because ""the capitol is angry"" or whatever. Honestly I couldn't believe the capitol was so genre-blind.9. The economic system of this country, with its diverse areas and iron-clad divisions, makes no sense and would be completely unsustainable.....And I'm going to stop there because I have a full-time job.","Mar 16, 2011"
"9780439023481","3699303","Lou","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3699303-lou","MY REVIEW The story is set in an time when the country is divided into districts and each year a girl and boy is selected 2 from each district to compete in a game of survival pitted against each other until only one winner remains that's 24 contestants. From district 12 is Katniss Everdeen a girl who lives in the seam, hunts in the woods trades in the Hob. She's going into the death game. Before the game of death all she new was survival and hunger. This a good page turner for all ages well written, you really feel you're there in the moment rooting for this young skilled girl and her fellow contestants.Let the games begin!September 12, 2008 Stephen King talks of The Hunger Games Stephen King finds a new YA novel as scarily addictive as his favorite arcade game.The Hunger GamesAs negative Utopias go, Suzanne Collins has created a dilly. The United States is gone. North America has become Panem, a TV-dominated dictatorship run from a city called the Capitol. The rest of Panem is divided into 12 Districts (the former 13th had the bad judgment to revolt and no longer exists). The yearly highlight in this nightmare world is the Hunger Games, a bloodthirsty reality TV show in which 24 teenagers chosen by lottery two from each District fight each other in a desolate environment called the ''arena.'' The winner gets a life of ease; the losers get death. The only ''unspoken rule'' is that you can't eat the dead contestants. Let's see the makers of the movie version try to get a PG-13 on this baby.Our heroine is Katniss Everdeen (lame name, cool kid), a resident of District 12, which used to be Appalachia. She lives in a desperately poor mining community called the Seam, and when her little sister's name is chosen as one of the contestants in the upcoming Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place. A gutsy decision, given the fact that District 12 hasn't produced a Hunger Games winner in 30 years or so, making them the Chicago Cubs of the postapocalypse world. Complicating her already desperate situation is her growing affection for the other District 12 contestant, a clueless baker's son named Peeta Mellark. Further complicating her situation is her sorta-crush on her 18-year-old hunting partner, Gale. Gale isn't clueless; Gale is smoldering. Says so right on page 14.The love triangle is fairly standard teen-read stuff; what 16-year-old girl wouldn't like to have two interesting guys to choose from? The rest of The Hunger Games, however, is a violent, jarring speed-rap of a novel that generates nearly constant suspense and may also generate a fair amount of controversy. I couldn't stop reading, and once I got over the main character's name (Gale calls her Catnip ugh), I got to like her a lot. And although ''young adult novel'' is a dumbbell term I put right up there with ''jumbo shrimp'' and ''airline food'' in the oxymoron sweepstakes, how many novels so categorized feature one character stung to death by monster wasps and another more or less eaten alive by mutant werewolves? I say more or less because Katniss, a bow-and-arrow Annie Oakley, puts the poor kid out of his misery before the werewolves can get to the prime cuts.Collins is an efficient no-nonsense prose stylist with a pleasantly dry sense of humor. Reading The Hunger Games is as addictive (and as violently simple) as playing one of those shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway. Balancing off the efficiency are displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults. When Katniss needs burn cream or medicine for Peeta, whom she more or less babysits during the second half of the book, the stuff floats down from the sky on silver parachutes. And although the bloody action in the arena is televised by multiple cameras, Collins never mentions Katniss seeing one. Also, readers of Battle Royale (by Koushun Takami), The Running Man, or The Long Walk (those latter two by some guy named Bachman) will quickly realize they have visited these TV badlands before.But since this is the first novel of a projected trilogy, it seems to me that the essential question is whether or not readers will care enough to stick around and find out what comes next for Katniss. I know I will. But then, I also have a habit of playing Time Crisis until all my quarters are gone.

I'm not sure what's it's about, except for personal freedom in a just society, but there's more to it than that. Katniss Everdeen has become very popular and has a flourish of copycats.

Well, I got that experience when I read this book called “The Hunger Games” and believe me this book took me on one dark and intense ride. “The Hunger Games” is an intense book by Suzanne Collins which details how a sixteen-year-old girl named Katniss Everdeen is thrown into the dreaded Hunger Games when she tries to save her sister, Prim from entering it. “The Hunger Games” may be too violent and intense for some readers to handle, but it is truly one of the most engaging books ever written!In the ruins of North America, there is a nation called Panem where it is ruled by the Capitol, which is full of cruel and ruthless people ruling the city. Every year, the Capitol would send in a boy and a girl from each district to compete in the dreaded Hunger Games, where competitors fight to the death to survive. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen realizes that her sister Prim is about to compete in the Hunger Games, she decides to take her sister’s place to save her life and now she is competing in the Hunger Games where she has to use all of her wits and strength to survive!Whew! I am definitely out of breath after I read this book! When I first heard about this book, I was trying to figure out what all the hype was all about on this book, but now I know! Suzanne Collins has certainly done an awesome job at writing this book that is full of intensity and suspense! What I loved the most about this book was how Suzanne Collins had perfectly built up the pace of the action in this book so that the readers do not have to feel like they do not know the characters that well since it might cause the plot of the story to move quickly. I will admit that when I first read this book, it started out really slow, but as soon as the Hunger Games begins, the action quickly picks up and I found myself being mesmerized by Suzanne Collins’ intensive writing and exciting plot that I could not put the book down! I also loved the characters in this book, especially Katniss Everdeen herself! Katniss is the pure strong heroine in this book as she struggles to survive in the Hunger Games and I loved the way that Katniss uses her knowledge of the forest and her wit to help her get through the Hunger Games. I also admired Katniss’ courage in this book as she was able to handle any obstacle that came at her and I loved the relationship between her and Peeta. Katniss' and Peeta's relationship with each other is not your average romantic couple since they are too busy trying to survive in the Hunger Games, but there are some cute moments between the two of them. Another thing I loved about this book was how the idea of “The Hunger Games” was thought up as I never would have thought that I would read a book that takes place in a post – apocalyptic world or in this case, after the destruction of North America and that idea easily intrigues me since you wonder to yourself about how can you create another civilization after the destruction of another civilization. I also think that this book reminded me of the gladiator tournaments that were held during Ancient Rome and even some of the characters’ names in this book seem to reflect the Roman names.There are many gory and violent scenes in this book, which includes many people dying in horrific ways. So, anyone who does not like gore or violence might feel a bit squeamish when reading this book. Also, the whole theme about how the Capitol toys with innocent people’s lives and views it as a sport is deeply disturbing.Overall, “The Hunger Games” is a truly worthy book to read over and over again and I will definitely be checking out the next two books in this fantastic series!Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog","Dec 15, 2010"

I've been actively not reading Twilight and Harry Potter for a very long time. I'm currently also actively not reading Fifty Shades of Grey although I am one of the twenty million people wearing the enforced cloak of shame after buying the bloody book and keeping it at the top of the bestest best books ever on the chart of bestness. I was also not reading The Hunger Games Trilogy for a while. Then Kingfan30 sent the book to me as a random-act-of-bookcrossing-kindness via www,bookcrossing.com and the games began...And the game is this, do you read it in the accepting happy, mostly non-questioning way that a twelve year old might read it and get a sort of wordy sugar rush of quick enjoyment? Or do you read it with your grumpy old person head on and then pick it apart from being a washed-out, watered down and limply dystopian fantasy for teenage girls with what I suspect to be an underlying theme touting chastity even in the most trying of situations?I tried both approaches and raced through the book wearing the head of an open minded twelve year old (WARNING Before people write in and complain this is just a figure of speech, I did not actually go out and acquire the head of a twelve year old to wear like an ill fitting hat while reading this book and this is not something you should do either). So far so happy place. Katniss Everdeen is all practical and outdoorsy like Ray Mear's little dystopian sister and she's got a boy who is a friend but not an actual boyfriend so it's ok, she and Gale can go off into the woods together for hours at a time and none of their parents are concerned that they might be out in the woods doing it under a travelling rug which was originally traded at the Hob for ten rabbits and a groosling.Then comes The Reaping, the selection for tributes for the Hunger Games from each of the Districts outside of The Capital. It's the lottery you really hope you're not going to win (unlike this weeks £200-odd million Euro millions role over). Katniss is not drawn - shock horror it's Prim her little sister, being offered up as a tribute instead, along with Peeta, a further potential boyfriend who already has a crush on the plucky heroine. Katniss steps in to save her little sis making the ultimate sacrifice and off to The Capital they go to be made over like movie stars and fed into the gristy mill of the press juggernaut. The Hunger Games require only one winner, therefore everyone else needs to be dead in as efficient, but entertaining a way as possible and quickly too. Katniss is ""lucky"" because most of the other competitors are only too happy to begin slaying each other immediately with great enthusiasm, rapidly reducing the competition but also leaving her paws unsullied. And wearing my teenage-head hat, I cheered for Katniss and wanted her to win. Yay! Go Katniss!Then the grumpy old person perspective started seeping in and I was forced to consider issues such as, if, as a teenager, I was almost assuredly likely to be butchered and spent a lot of time snuggled up in a cave, sucking the face of a not unappealing sixteen year old boy in return for food and medicine (er is this a form of prostitution?), then maybe I'd be thinking that now would be a good time for one last, or in Katniss's case, first shag. Everything is just a bit too chaste and I'm sure a lot of mid teens will be reading this book and thinking ""wow, there's any number of wasted opportunities here"". Don't forget though, Katniss is metaphor for the hopes and dreams of all who battle against tyranny so that keeps her pretty busy most of the time.Ultimately Katniss is successful in re-emerging from the arena with her sanity, integrity and virginity still intact which is the Hunger Games equivalent of winning Gold, Silver and Bronze at the Olympics.","Jul 18, 2012"

I really couldn't take my eyes off the pages!Ha Ha! Look into my eyes!Ah-hem! So, when I started reading this book, Katniss' character immediately felt real. With her family's daily struggle to survive Katniss is forced to hunt in the surrounding forest which is highly illegal in District 12 the poorest district in Panem. Katniss has learnt her wilderness knowledge from her father who was killed in a coal mining accident. I loved the part where against all odds Prim Katniss' younger sister's name is pulled out of the Reaping and Katniss immediately voluteers as tribute. Katniss' feelings in those moments training in the Capitol are what confused me. How can she (or anyone else for that matter) be so calm and collected knowing she could be killed in a couple days time?? I also didn't understand why she liked her prep team so much cause as Gail said in a later book ""..they prettied you up for slaughter."" Something else that mystified me was the appearance of an Avox girl whom Katniss saw in the forest trying supposedly to escape from the Capitol a few years back.The Avox girl and Katniss developed a sort of friendship and I believed at the time this Avox girl would play a part with Katniss in the next installment.In the Launch Room before the Games Katniss' true fears emerge. At last!Once in the Arena things really begin to speed up action-wise. There was plenty of fighting and gore, and I found the parts about Rue really sad although I saw them coming in a way...Katniss handled every situation very well, but it still shocks me that anyone would enjoy watching the death and suffering of children. Of course for an epic book there was an epic ending which met up to ALL (if not more) of my expectations, so anyone out there who hasn't tried this series hasn't lived. I've got to say I found this book shocking (but that's because I was soft back then and new to fiction) when I read the blurb but when I started reading I was immersed in Katniss' world. There was the promise that Katniss' hunger games were going to be very different... Plus there's also the love triangle with Peeta, Gail and Katniss...

Really it's the voice. To be in the first person, and that first person to supposedly be abt. 18 with little education... well, I just don't buy the way that she is talking, and it's bouncing me out of the story bad. It doesn't help that she describes a lot of things that don't need describing too, 'I watched Gale cut the bread'.... Come on, can't Gale just cut the bread? All the 'I' statements make for a rather tedious self-absorbed perspective. First person doesn't have to be that way though, naughty lazy writer. Bad, no Nobel for you. I'm really really hoping this gets better, and I plan to finish if for no other reason than further research into what sort of writing can become a best seller. So far though... well... it's agony.Arg! ""Conducted, slumber, verve, tenuous, of late..."" Are these really words/expressions that this character would use? Really? I call BS. This book is driving me crazy. And yes, I know that these complaints make me sound like some diction harpy, but come on!Oh thank god I'm done with this sad excuse for a novel. I read all the way to the end hoping that all the graphic nonsense would build up to something. Sad sad sad. The voice never got better, or well it remained what seemed to be a 45yr old recently fired psychopathic adjunct professor and I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief. The gore was never a problem because I never cared for any of the characters. Of course it tried to play at the themes of tyranny and brutality, but with classics like _House of Stairs_, and _Lord of the Flies_ Why would you torture yourself with this?On evaluation for why this book has been such a success, I think the lesson here is action. It does buzz along at a furious clip, and perhaps when I was younger that would have been enough for me to overlook flaws. But I suppose that is why I generally stay away from this varietal of fiction anymore... matter of fact, I think I'll go back to that plan A.","Dec 25, 2010"

"9780439023481","1570669"," Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books","I can't imagine how hard it was to write a novel about kids being forced to kill each other. Probably much harder than it was to read it. After all, in my limited viewpoint as a person who also writes (although unpublished), I really dislike hurting my beloved, lifelike characters, and much less killing them, or having them do terrible things, unless they are supposed to because they are evil.But Ms. Collins had to take kids between the ages of 12-16 and force them to deliberately harm each other.It's a journey into a world in which a whole society plans events and festivities around such barbarism. It's not the Roman Empire. It's a dark future in which North America has become a much smaller continent called Panem. The society is a dystopic one in which the resources are not so much limited as restricted and deliberately kept from those regions whose denizens participated in a rebellion over 40 years ago. Their punishment is to have twenty-four of their children, two from each District, selected in a process called the Reaping. Those who are chosen must go and fight in the Hunger Games. If you've seen Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, then the phrase ""two men enter, one man leaves"" sort of gives you the idea. Except in this case, it's twenty-four kids enter, and one leaves.Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen, grows up to the age of 16 in this world. She has been taking care of her family since she was 11, hunting illegally in the forests beyond the fence around District 12, bringing back fresh meat and wild plants to feed her young sister and mother. Her heart has become hard so she can survive. But when the day comes of the Reaping, and her young sister Prim's name is called, she volunteers to go to the games in her place, almost unprecedented. Most people know that they won't return, especially the poorly-trained and outfitted tributes from District 12. But her sister is not going to face the sure death that awaits her in the Games. Not when she can.The other tribute from District 12 is Peeta Mellark, the baker's son. A boy who did a life-saving act of kindness to Katniss several years before, one she can never forget. She doesn't like him for that reason, also because he reminds her of what she doesn't have, as essentially a townie, when her family lives on the fringes, the offspring of a deceased miner. However, they will have to form an alliance dreamed up by their sponsor, Haymitch, who won the Games many years before. He's a drunk, but he is going to do what he can to keep at least one of them alive in the Games.I wasn't looking forward to reading this. I don't care for dystopian fiction. And the thought of kids killing each other, well it doesn't work for me. However, I decided to give this a read and bought the book a few years ago. Managed to put it off until now. When the Action Heroines group on Goodreads selected it as a group read this month, the choice was made. I started it, and was crying, not too far into the book (made even more painful by the fact that I have a nasty cold right now with a bad sore throat). I was sucked in.I love a tough, survivor heroine, and Katniss is definitely that. Not only a survivor, but a girl who made sacrifices for her family. She's without a doubt, a very well-developed character. I like the fact that Collins takes the effort to describe Katniss' thought processes so well in this book, her woodcraft, her no-nonsense approach to life. How she suppresses those soft emotions that would have been a liability to her in her present situation. But deep down, how Katniss has the potential for love, and she does love. When Katniss bonds with another tribute, a young girl named Rue, who reminds her of Primrose, I could literally hear and feel my heart breaking. We all know how this ends. And Katniss best of all. But that doesn't mean you can stop feeling emotions, even when the brutal reality of your existence and forced choices seem to dictate otherwise.That's part of what makes this a difficult story. The fact that kids are forced into a world in which they starve to death, not because there is nothing to eat, but because someone feels that they shouldn't have the basic things like a full belly and a safe life, for political reasons. That's going on today in this world. It should break a person's heart, and it does. Is this so very out there, when in real life, there are child soldiers in the world right now? I know I'm going towards ""Soapbox"" territory, so I'll stop myself. Yeah, I guess that's the point. Why should I keep my blindfold on to these horrors and immerse myself in safe, happy tales all the time? And forget that events like this do happen (maybe not in this obvious, fictional landscape kind of way), but in a way that is lot less showcased, and much more brutal.I admit I liked the role reversal here. Peeta, the boy is more emotional, more approachable, more in need of protection. And Katniss is tougher, more armored, the protector. That doesn't hold true across the map, for Peeta shows depths that surprise Katniss and the reader. And likewise, Katniss has her moments when she doesn't have it all figured out.Since this is first person, we don't get to find out how the grown-ups feel about this travesty. But I can surmise that people like Haymitch, Cinna, even Effie feel their share of anguish for the roles they play every year, as they watch twenty-four more children go off, most of them to their deaths, even if it's well-hidden.It's a mad world, and all this comes together in this story to propel me through a gamut of emotions, most of them uncomfortable. I could almost identify with the kids, that horror of knowing, ""This is it."" The Games are real. I was there with them, and I wasn't spared the realness. I guess that's another reason to respect this work, that the author doesn't soften such a terrible concept. She doesn't allow you to settle into a false sense of security that it will be alright. That would only be a form of contempt in my mind. If you're going to go there, then bring it. And she does.My final verdict: The Hunger Games is tough reading. But it's complex and powerful, and completely involving. I couldn't stop reading this until I was done.","Nov 09, 2009"
"9780439023481","42508","Greg","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg","This might have some spoilers about books that aren't this one. You have been warned.Part way through the second book of Suzanne Collins' Gregor the Overlander series it struck me what I really liked about her. She had no problem with killing off someone in the story, and not in the 'oh you think the person is dead, but then they turn out alive' kind of way. Nope she'd just knock someone off when you weren't even expecting it. Not a lot of writers will do this. Generally you can expect that in the middle of a book a likable character isn't going to get killed, but she did this in a book for eight year olds. Her other series is pretty satisfying as far as kid's books go, they are very simple to read but they are still good. Honestly this could have been an adult novel. I don't really know where the line is between young adult and adult novels, but this is about as dark a dystopia as most of those created, and unlike most dystopian novels this one actually is engaging once you get past the social commentary and interesting (or not so interesting way) the author has imagined a future world full of shit. Maybe it is because Collins doesn't hark on the dystopia aspect too much that it is a books for kids, but she lays out enough of the awfulness and gives enough social criticism to keep the ideas of a futile and oppressive future pretty firmly rooted into every page of the novel. And then there is the story, it's about kids killing kids in a reality tv show that everyone in the country is forced to watch. Ever since Running Man, (movie or short story), I have been fascinated with the idea of people killing each in a reality TV show, and this falls into that tradition that also includes Battle Royale. This book is better than BR, which I really liked, but which kind of got a bit stale at some point. It's sort of like BR, mixed with Jackson's short story ""The Lottery"" (the only short story I can remember really liking as a middle school student). I'm a little afraid of the second book. I'm not sure if the story can keep up the momentum this one had. Even if I don't like the next book in the series, I can love the top rated review already up for the next book, it makes me feel all warm inside that I can really love a book that seems to appeal to the 'who will the main character really love' interest that Twilight produces, and has the same name calling as if the characters were real people. It feels good to be involved in mass pop-culture. Now bring on the TV show where kids hunt other kids down, that might be what I need to finally get an antenna or cable in my apartment.","Aug 10, 2009"

Even though three stars isn’t bad compared how I normally rate my books but this is the Hunger Games so this deserves a high rating. Right? Well unlike everyone else I didn’t find this book to be as fantastic as everyone says. Giving it three stars usually, means I like the book and I did like this book…but a lot of things ruined it for me. Sure there were amazing this about this book and it probably is great but I had so much trouble liking this book like everyone else. I never planned on reading this series so when the movie came out I watched with no intention of ever picking up the book. At the time I wasn’t much of an avid reader as I am now. Also at the time dystopia was my favorite genre but not when I finally picked up this book. When I watched the movie I knew everything so I saw no point in reading the book but then I did end up reading it. The plot is really good but because I knew what was going to happen I found it…well, quite boring. I’m sure this series it remarkable but not for me. I feel like because I watched the movie I was spoiled for the book. I still haven't watched the other movies nor read the books but I’ve been spoiled for the books to come and they aren’t just little spoilers. I read this book at the wrong time. I’m sure that if I read it before I watched the movie and when I really liked the dystopian genre then I would have loved it. That’s why I gave it three stars because I know that this book isn’t terrible and that maybe considering I don’t exactly what’s going to come in the next books I might like them more. This book was one of those ‘it’s me not you’ cases. I liked this book but not as much as I hoped to.","Apr 19, 2016"

It was well paced, exciting and I cared about the characters. I even teared up a little at one point. I particularly liked all the little hints that there is more than meets the eye going on here.I read this first part in less than 48 hours (mainly due to having about 4000 microfilm slides to catalog at work; thank goodness for audiobooks...

"9780439023481","1169804","Steph (Reviewer X)","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1169804-steph-reviewer-x","One of the biggest reasons I loved this book isn’t because every chapter literally ended with a sentence that made you want to keep reading or because of the romance (which is usually what wins me over, I must say). Rather, it’s how deep of a level it reaches. I just finished it, so naturally there hasn’t been enough time for reflection, but in these few moments, my stream of thought is going spastic. The book jacket wasn’t lying—there’s mystery, adventure, romance, suspense, all of that in here. And yet the substance of the novel surpasses just these box-office-hit qualities (which is all I can compare those four adjectives to).The world building was fantastic. While it’s quite a different land than current North America, Panem had some disturbing parallels relating to the society, especially of its higher class (the lower-number districts and the Capitol). The fixation with the sappy romance, the fact the games were more like a deadlier reality show of nowadays than anything else, the frivolousness... It was quite unnerving. So clever. Only adds another layer to this story.Not many books have kept me on the edge of my seat. This plot is brilliant. Truth be told, I’m not the biggest fan of thrillers and am fine with books that employ the “girl-next-door” dynamics to its plot—quiet, but charming and accessible. Well, needless to say, this book is anything but quiet. But it is bewitching.You know what? I’ll stop. There’s nothing I can say that hasn’t already been said. Plus I could stay here all night. I wasn’t kidding when I said my mind is going spastic with all the directions this book gives it to think things out.Not recommending it to everyone though. Some really hate violence. Some really hate dystopia. I’d still give it a shot if you’re one of those people, but I wouldn’t specifically recommend it to you. Everyone else? Knock yourselves out. This is one of the ultimate must-reads right in front of you.But in short: this book is AWESOME.","Sep 15, 2008"

It's extremely well written and has blown away readers in all age groups. I got caught up in it and recommend it highly.But there are a couple of problems. The heroine is sadly rather dense for someone so smart. You'll spend a lot of time shaking your head. I won't say more as that would entail a spoiler or spoilers, so....I finally settled on a four star rating because of a few glitches that just drove me crazy. For example,the protagonist standing giving a blow by blow account of someone being killed until the killer turns on her. You're wondering Why the h*** aren't you already twenty yards away. The character has stayed in one place for no good reason leading to her being in very bad spot when she could have taken to her heels during the other fight(assuming she wasn't going to take part when it would have been more advantageous for her of course). There were several places where I wanted to put my head through a wall in frustration asking ""why aren't you..."" or ""why are you ..."" . A few times it was like watching a character in a ""dead teenager movie"" go to the basement ""armed"" with only a flash-light to investigate the ""strange noise"" when they know the slasher has already killed three of his/her friends.But that was only a few times...on the whole this is a wonderful read. I had a library copy, but went out and bought a copy of this and the next volume.Recommended.Update: Unfortunately things didn't pan out and I was very disappointed in the third volume of this series. That's sad, because the first (this one) was excellent and the second one good.

I was completely blown away, in a good way. :) The plot, the characters, the entire world Collins created is completely original and unlike anything I've ever encountered before. I'd heard that this book was good, but I had no idea that it would be this amazing. Why I let it sit on my shelf for so long before giving it a shot is beyond my comprehension. From the very fist chapter, I felt myself bonding with the characters. They are incredibly realistic, and they bring the story to life. Katniss is a strong protagonist that I can admire and believe. Unlike some strong female characters, Katniss' tough personality is a learned skill instead of a personality trait. This helped me to understand her a lot more. The other tributes and characters are equally interesting. They all certainly added to my love of the novel. I've always loved drama. Who doesn't like a bit of suspense in their books? Everything about The Hunger Games is dramatic- from the reaping to the games. I was constantly wondering what would happen next. This is one of the first books I've read in a long time that had me sneaking away to my room every chance I got. I was desperate to find out what happened next. While the concept of teens battling it out in an area is somewhat disturbing, it was impossible to not be fascinated. The Hunger Games is now one of my favorite books. It was absolutely brilliant, and I will be recommending it to all of my fellow readers. I've heard awesome things about the sequel, Catching Fire, and I cannot wait to see what happens next in this captivating series. Five stars!","Mar 07, 2010"

The fact that this book was so popular among children is equally horrendous.What is omitted from Hunger Games is also a problem. (1) There is no discussion of who is wielding the power to make children murderers, nor how they got that power. (2) Other than a single line, I can't recall any hint that the heroine can even conceive of an act of rebellion. There is a passive acceptance of the status quo that is disturbingly reminiscent of Hitler's Germany. I am told that this question is somewhat addressed in volumes 2 & 3 of the trilogy, but by then it is too late, especially for those children who read only volume 1.It is well past time, especially in light of the recent murder of 20 babies in Connecticut, to consider the impact on young people of such literature, along with comparable movies and video games.","Feb 04, 2012"
"9780439023481","1292720","Janni","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1292720-janni","How the world ends: The usual--droughts, storms, fires, rising sea levels. When the dust cleared--over what used to be the U.S., at least--we were left with the nation of Panem, with its Capitol surrounded by 12 (once 13) districts that are entirely subservient to it and produce the goods to sustain it. The districts did try to rebel once, and lost, and as a result every district is required to select a girl and a boy to participate in the Capitol's yearly Hunger Games, a fight-to-the-death (literally--only one is allowed to survive) reality TV show that sets 24 young contestants against each other in the game arena.My own personal dystopia is pretty one in which our lives are television controlled. I don't watch much TV, and reality television (what little--admittedly--I've watched of it) makes me acutely uncomfortable, because it seems to function on the basis of selecting and then manipulating its participants into various bits of not-admirable or at least not-quite-real behavior, and then working to convince us that this is how people are and that we're seeing realistic portrayals of how people are. The ""only one person can win"" mentality of many of these shows exaggerates this, and denies the fact that in real life, people are cooperative, we work together--not over the short term but also over the long one, we have reasons to work together and besides we want to.So this was not a comfortable read for me. The characters--even our protagonist, fiercely competent, independent Katniss, who claims not to be good with people but regularly puts her life on the line for those she cares about without a second thought--are acutely aware of the media and their audience, and of how both are watching them even as they play in the games. And it's not idle awareness--if the audience likes you, sponsors will give you life-saving gifts; if they don't, they won't. In some ways, that was the creepiest thing of all, for me--that your survival might depend not only on your physical skills, but also on how well you can play to an audience.I read this one pretty quickly. I assumed it would be an uncomfortable read, but I think the thing that made it truly work for me, at the end, was realizing that--the story actually gets how dystopic this stuff is, not just in the surface way I was expecting, but down to the prices it carries--prices that go well beyond the simple brutalizing effects of having to kill for the entertainment of others, and include the prices of having to create a persona--which may or may match your own, and in the end can even you really tell?--and perform for the cameras, as well. Good stuff.The parallels to our own society go well beyond the reality TV aspects, too. Some chilling things there, too, almost on a par with M.T. Anderson's Feed at times, though perhaps not quite as bleak. (But you can work in a lot of bleak before you get as bleak as Feed.)

In North America, the survivors created Panem, a Capitol city in the Rockies with 13 outlying Districts, each focusing on producing a different product for the Capitol: gems, coal, agriculture, fishing etc. In Katniss' district, District 12, they mine coal. It's one of the poorest districts, a district that never stands a chance in the Hunger Games because the children are so starving. Since her father died in a mining accident when she was twelve, Katniss has hunted illegally in the forest, developing a formidable skill with the bow and arrow to bring fresh meat back to the town to trade for things for her family: her mother and her little sister Prim.Now sixteen, Katniss finds herself in a nightmare predicament: against all odds, her twelve-year-old sister Prim has been selected as a tribute for the Hunger Games. After a rebellion amongst the Districts against the Capitol was ferociously put down years ago, the city instigated the Hunger Games as a deathly reminder that the working people of the Districts live by the Capitol's whim. The people of the Capitol treat the Games like the year's best entertainment, and are giddy with excitement to watch twenty-four children aged from 12 to 18 - a boy and girl from each District - kill each other before the cameras, and the victor is celebrated like a hero. In the Districts, winning the Hunger Games brings fame and food to your district, and the winner is set for life.But Prim is only twelve, and aside from having her mother's knack at healing, has no survival skills. Katniss doesn't hesitate for a moment before volunteering to take her place. Let the Hunger Games begin.The YA field is ideal for exploring post-apocalyptic worlds and the changing, often brutal nature of humanity - I think because its readers, typically 13+, are at the age where they too are changing and discovering themselves as independent people. What more intense, vivid way is there to explore the great philosophical questions of human nature in an entertaining and gripping way than through post-apocalyptic fiction? In times of crisis and chaos and our own worst nightmares, we discover what we're made of.The Hunger Games is a wonderful new addition to the canon. Leaning more toward sci-fi than fantasy with its advanced technology, it resurrects the horror people can inflict on each other that was so well captured in the short story ""The Lottery""; the cruelty of pitting innocent children against each other that was so vividly brought to life in Battle Royale (not a YA book but one which is most similar to this); and the survival instincts and honour that can come to the surface when faced with a kill-or-be-killed scenario, which reminded me of one of my favourite series, John Marsden's Tomorrow series. I'm sure you can think of many more too.Narrated by Katniss, it's a good guess that she survives (though I wouldn't have been surprised to have that expectation turned on me), since she does narrate in the present tense. That in itself is a somewhat unusual choice and I'm not entirely sure it worked here. Present tense is generally used to create more tension, a stronger feeling of ""now"" and of an unpredictable future - everything you need in the Hunger Games. Perhaps it was the incorrect use of the past tense ""lay"" instead of the present tense ""lie"" that cropped up constantly that jarred me? It certainly annoyed me! No, it was because, somehow, it read more like Katniss telling a story long after it had happened. I can't quite put my finger on how this could be, but it lacked the tension that other books using present tense have managed to capture, which was a bit disappointing.The Hunger Games themselves were riveting, much like the grisly slaughter of Battle Royale but less gory. There were a couple of scenes that I wished I weren't eating breakfast over, but most of the deaths happen ""off screen"", as it were. What's more compelling is the class divide that gapes as wide as the jaws of Hell, the prejudice and persecution and the politics behind it all - I'm sure this will be more fully explored in the next books in the series. I was a bit disappointed that the initial cause of the problems in this world, the environmental degradation and, ultimately, destruction, wasn't explored further - nor were the handy technological advances seen in the Capitol. Granted, it's not the focal point of the story, merely helps set up the premise, but I find the lack of personal responsibility and this assumption that someone will invent the technology to make everything better that I hear all around me today, is reflected between the lines of this novel. Things just magically appear in the Capitol, and isn't that our dream? To have the best our intellect can give us without any consequence? Yet, this book is all about consequences, just of a different sort of action. So this isn't a quibble about the story; it just made me think of the many flaws in our own world that, even after this particular ""apocalypse"", are still being repeated.Katniss herself is a great protagonist, with spunk, survival skills that make us look helpless (few people know what's edible in the wild and what isn't, who aren't botanists, or what leaves draw pus from wounds etc.), and conflicting emotions that are no less familiar for the situation she's in. The scene with Rue and the bread from District 11 made me cry, but it was the memory Katniss retells of Peeta giving her the bread when they were children that won me over.Like many new fans of Collins, I'll be eagerly waiting the second book in the series, Catching Fire, due out 1st September 2009.","Mar 19, 2009"
"9780439023481","10592271","BrokenTune","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune","This is a combined review of the trilogy as a whole.""When I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the things I would blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts.""I managed to forego reading the books until a few weeks ago when I needed to find some common topic of conversation with someone that I otherwise have little in common with. There is only so much small talk I can bear, and I knew that The Hunger Games was something the other person was interested in. So, I figured I'd read the first book for the silliest of reasons.What I had not expected was that I adored the first installment and ended up having to read the rest of the series.What still baffles me is how Collins actually managed to lean on so many existing stories and works of literature and still come away with a story that reads so utterly gripping and original. My initial reaction on reading was to make comparisons to The Lottery and Lord of the Flies and 1984 and every gladiator-themed movie I have ever watched but I soon left these aside to enjoy the story of Katniss Everdeen (Is Collins a fan of the English pastoral as well as ancient Rome?) and the country of Panem just for itself. The literary tributes (haha) became rather fun to look for - like a party game between author and reader - but they did not distract from the story.So, what about the story?Well, we have the Katniss and Peeta who are chosen (by lottery) as tributes from their districts to compete against the ""tributes"" from other districts in a televised fight with with goal to be the last tribute alive and win the prize of ensuring their family's food supply for the rest of their lives. So, again cue the reference to the panem et circenses of Ancient Rome - except that The Hunger Games have the additional twist that they were set up as punishment for the districts' rise against the Capitol some seventy years earlier.""You get the feeling that the knot-tying class is not the Hunger Games hot spot.""As Katniss and her fellow tributes began the ""games"", it was very hard to put down the book even for short breaks. The story took on a whole new level as I tried to figure out what motives the different characters had and whether they were trustworthy or not. Yep, a YA book actually had me on the edge of my seat, and by the of book 1 it was not even a question whether I'd read on to find out whether the revolution would win or fail.""At some point, you have to stop running and turn around and face whoever wants you dead. The hard thing is finding the courage to do it. Well, it’s not hard for Gale. He was born a rebel. I’m the one making an escape plan.""And that's another thing - One of the frustrations I have with books is predictability. Not so here. Nowhere in the trilogy did I get a sense of what the ending would be like. I loved it. I also really liked the characters: None of them are perfect, least of all Katniss, but that gives them some depth and over the course of the books, Collins gives her characters room to develop and shows the impact of the story on the different personalities - not just the violence and cruelty they are faced with but also the influence of friendships and acts of kindness they witness. ""We’re fickle, stupid beings with poor memories and a great gift for self-destruction.""N.B. Catching Fire (Book 2) is the weakest of the trilogy and basically only acts as the bridge between The Hunger Games and Mockingjay. It's still worth reading, but nowhere near as ""original"" (not using the word lightly given the many references to existing stories) as Books 1 and 3.","Dec 06, 2015"

Δεν ξέρω αν με ρωτάτε ποια είναι τα κριτήρια για την τόσο μεγάλη εμπορική επιτυχία μιας νεανικής σειράς (θα την είχα γράψει εγώ αν ήξερα), αλλά σε κάθε περίπτωση και τα τρία βιβλία είναι καλογραμμένα και τα απόλαυσα (σε αντίθεση με άλλα ΥΑ που με κουράζουν και δεν με πείθουν).Στο πρώτο και εισαγωγικό βιβλίο, μαθαίνουμε πως το Panem, η χώρα στην οποία ζει και δρα η Κατνίς αποτελείται από την πρωτεύουσα – την Capitol – και 12 περιοχές – επαρχίες, καθεμία από τις οποίες παράγει κάτι: πχ ψαρεύουν, καλλιεργούν τη Γη, κλπ. Η Κατνίς μένει στη 12η περιοχή, η οποία είναι η περιοχή των μεταλλείων. Ο πατέρας της ήταν μεταλλωρύχος, ο οποίος σκοτώθηκε σε μια έκρηξη («δεν είχαμε καν πτώμα να θάψουμε») και το βάρος της επιβίωσης της οικογένειας πέφτει κυρίως στη 17χρονη Κατνίς, καθώς η μητέρα της δεν έχει συνέλθει ακόμα από το θάνατο του συζύγου της, και η αδερφή της είναι μικρή (12 ετών). Ισχύει επίσης ότι κάθε χρόνο, κάθε μία από τις 12 περιοχές παρέχει – κατόπιν κλήρωσης – ένα νέο και μια νέα με σκοπό τη συμμετοχή τους στους «αγώνες πείνας», ένα σκληρό ριάλιτι επιβίωσης που διεξάγεται σε ειδική πίστα – στούντιο – λαβύρινθο στην Κάπιτολ. Από τους 24 συμμετέχοντες θα κερδίσει ένας, αυτός που θα εξουδετερώσει όλους τους υπόλοιπους – ναι, θα είναι ο τελευταίος που θα μείνει ζωντανός. Η έμπνευση της συγγραφέα ήταν τα ρεάλιτι της τηλεόρασης, τα οποία ήταν μεταφορικά ανθρωποφαγικά, κι αυτή είπε να κάνει τη μεταφορά κυριολεξία. Επίσης νομίζω πως όντως ήξερε το μύθο του Μινώταυρου και τους νέους αθηναίους και αθηναίες που θυσιάζονταν κάθε χρόνο για να θυμούνται την κυριαρχία της Κνωσού, εδώ της Κάπιτολ επί των περιοχών. Τέλος, η συγγραφέας κατηγορήθηκε ότι αντέγραψε κάτι ιαπωνικό, το οποίο εγώ αγνοώ. Προφανώς η Κατνίς είναι το κορίτσι που εκπροσωπεί την περιοχή της στους αγώνες. Εκεί αντιμετωπίζει πολλές δυσκολίες επιβίωσης, απώλειας και λοιπών καταστάσεων που αν τις αναλύσω θα κάνω μεγάλο σπόιλερ! Το βιβλίο το βρήκα πολύ εμπνευσμένο και η ταινία ήταν εξίσου καλή, πιστή μεταφορά του βιβλίου. Προτείνεται σε όσους αγαπούν το είδος (δυστοπική περιπέτεια).","Nov 23, 2013"

I just couldn't be ""one of those guys"" that hasn't read the popular book that almost every other human from my socio-economic background has read and be even more out of touch with popular culture than I already am--I am just now, thanks to the tireless efforts of the gf to make me less ""obscure"", catching on to ""she's the man"" references that have flown completely beneath my radar. Do you like cheese?So, I figured that twenty hours would be plenty of time to lick this slim entry in preteen pop culture. It was more than enough time. Did you know this is a YA novel AND features the brutal murder of children? I think that was what took me aback the most in this book--nearly every character is completely DGAF* about stabbing, shooting, dismembering, poisoning, and drugging their fellow competitors. Is this some kind of political allegory?If so, then so is gladiator, and no where in the hunger games, do we get heroic roman names like ""maximus decimus meridius leader of the armies of the north""; instead, there are things like peeta bread and catnip which seemed almost intentionally strange and obscure to me, but then again, so do all names in the fantasy genre.I don't want to say that this book was bad, because it went so quickly and thus could not have made me feel uncomfortable per se (twss), and I don't think it's ""badly written"" necessarily. I mean, it's no Nabokov, let's be real, but it serves its purpose. It has a tightly constructed plot that eschews a lot of exposition in favor of fast pacing and action. And I'm sure that that was what grabbed most of the readers and that's what's responsible for its runaway success, and it's certainly responsible for me getting through nearly three pages in a minute while reading it the night before the movie. On those grounds, I can't really knock it down or condescend like I would twilight or fifty shades etc. etc. So I'm forced to sneer at it across the room as all the other kids make conversation with it and have a good old time, not that I'm being intentionally reclusive here, just that it didn't really do much of anything for me. And that is not even a legitimate complaint given the dreadful state of my ""read"" books this year. I'm happy to have padded my shelf just a bit. Is that good enough for a four star rating?Maybe. Probably not. I did, however, enjoy the movie, simply on the grounds that in the book, the prose was ultra dull and thus did not supply nearly as enough entertainment dopamine (ED) to my brain as the explosive, constant-shaky-cam of the movie. And with the movie, we are broken out of the limitations of the catnip first person. The movie gives us a broader scope of the hunger games world, which (with the help of the always loveable woody harrelson) handled the politics of a futuristic, corporate-controlled world quite well. In the book, all the writing that doesn't include the fighting and senseless murder of children, mostly consists of catnip explaining everything that has already happened in the book (in case you were too dull to pick up on the already obvious and easy-to-digest plot, or you just weren't paying attention (me))and her complaining how she's too cold or too hungry. Riveting stuff.*another pop culture term I picked up from the gf meaning ""doesn't give a fuck"" and apparently works just fine as an adjective like that, as do the words: ""nast"", ""presh"", ""totes presh"", ""adorbs"", and of course the ever lovable and excessive ""totes presh adorbs"".","Jul 24, 2013"

I thought that I either wouldn't like this book or I would just think it was OK. I thought it was fantastic. The story is very real and gripping. It has depth, and I loved how it brought in politics and entertainment and was slamming the media. It was great. Some of the scenes were genuinely terrifying (the dogs scared the shit out of me and genuinely disturbed me) while some were heart breaking (you all know which scene ripped my heart out but I was also surprisingly really upset about Foxface too). I loved Haymitch and kept getting annoyed when Katniss was really rude about him, moaning about him being an alcoholic and a coward, etc. After having already been through what she was about to go through, I think he's allowed to be grumpy and drink as much as he wants. I did still like Katniss, though. She was a great heroine and I loved that she was three dimensional. She had character flaws and these weren't hidden or glossed over. Peeta is lovely, and I would definitely want him as my friend. I also love Effie, I hope there's more of her in the next two books.My only gripe was that I felt like there was too much focus on the fake/real romance between Peeta and Katniss. It wasn't the main plot, which meant I didn't mind it too much, but they spent a lot of time on it. I was getting bored when they ended up spending so long in that cave with Katniss trying to fake the romance. I understood why they were getting them to do it, and I appreciate it, but I just didn't really like it. However, I do now have an opinion on the love triangle which I didn't really have one either way before. I think Katniss clearly doesn't like Peeta as much as she likes Gale so she should be with Gale and I'll be with Peeta. That just seems like the right option for everyone. Ok, my opinion on this may have also been slightly pushed by the movies (Josh>Liam for me) but, still. I just think it sounds like the most logical next step.Overall, I actually loved reading this and I really enjoyed myself. It was fascinating and exciting and I'll definitely be reading the next two books at some point.","Nov 17, 2015"

I couldn't even get past the first few chapters. I found it trite, slow-moving, predictable, not written that well, and completely unrealistic. I didn't like any of the characters. The heroine is judgmental and self-righteous. The plot has been done much better most notably The Long Walk by Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman. Being a mom, I would fight to the death for my children (and I didn't give birth to them--I hear biological parents have even stronger bonds) and almost every mom I know is the same. To protect our young is our most basic animal instinct. (I'm a foster parent so I know there are some that wouldn't but it's actually quite rare--most believe they are doing what is best for their children when the kids are with them. Most parents fight for their kids in court no matter how bad they are at parenting.) I believe there would be mass rebellion rather than put up with this murderous game let alone make it entertaining. Plus, these are descendants of Americans, who culturally believe in rebellion and go to war at the drop of a hat, and it's not far enough in the future for that to have been beaten out of these people. I think this story would be absurd in most cultures but Americans have been indoctrinated into a culture of rebellion since the birth of the country. The book might be entertaining for some but for me, it's completely ridiculous.","Jun 28, 2009"

This was my third time reading it and my experience was as good as the first time around, if not better. It's one that honestly never gets dull.

  ★ As The useless chick who wouldn’t survive a round: Anna (2nd!)★ As The absolute fanatic: Chelsea (4th!)★ As The determined movie-whore: Harriet (1st!)★ As The enthusiastic newbie: Jenny (1st!)★ As The foxface unknown: Kat (2nd!)★ As The die-hard fan: Laura (3rd!)AND ME!! ★ As The deadly shot new recruit : Jen (1st!)This review is for all of you out there that have held out, like I did, because you weren’t sure whether you wanted to read this book.  Whether it was the hype or you didn't want to step into a world where kids brutally murdered other kids (I’m the latter). Where there could only be one winner out of twenty four contestants.  Where you're afraid it's filled with viciousness and that the pages will haunt you or make you cry.  Because that's where I was.  But my lovely blog buddy, Chelsea, pushed me out of my comfort zone.  She bought me this trilogy and then after I still hadn’t read it, she organized a buddy read with five other of our friends.  There was no backing out after that.  While I was always morbidly curious what all the hype was about, I decided to plunge head first and hope that I'd make it out while clinging onto my sanity.  While I was an emotional mess through much of the story, it won me over.  And I hope you'll step out of your comfort zone and read it too!   
  “Katniss, it’s just hunting. You’re the best hunter I know,” says Gale.
  
    “It’s not just hunting. They’re armed. They think,” I say. 
  
    “So do you. And you’ve had more practice. Real practice,” he says. “You know how to kill.”
  
    “Not people,” I say.
So what won me over?1. 	   A heroine I can respect.  First and foremost Katniss is one of the main reasons I fell in love with this book. She's a survivor who stepped up and is the sole reason her family is alive and didn't starve to death after her father died.  I respected how much responsibility she took on at a young age and how it morphed her into a determined, tough woman.  But she isn't just a hunter and provider.  She's a good friend to her best friend and fellow hunter, Gale.  And she is like a second mom to her little sister, Prim.  It was easy to like Katniss and to sympathize with her.  Especially when she stepped up and volunteered to take her sister's place in The Hunger Games. 2. 	   The simplistic aspect of the storytelling.  The way the story is delivered makes it easy to fall into their world.  The details are enough to get a good grasp on everything, but never to the point where it is overwhelming or will bore you.  It honestly reads as though I was having a movie play in my head. 3. 	   A fast paced story that you'll constantly be thinking about. It was impossible to put this book down.  There was so much going on that I had to know what would happen next.  And when I did have to put this book down due to life, boo, the scenes kept replaying in my head.  I kept trying to guess what was going to happen next, and it became all consuming! 4. 	   A boy you will want to put your faith in, I think?   Peeta, her fellow district competitor, constantly had my attention and I struggled with how to view him.  At times he could appear so selfless and heartfelt and other times he would appear cold, calculating and a true opponent.  He will keep you intrigued and make you want to learn more about him.  Because in one moment he'll be melting your heart and other times he will turn it to ice!  I loved Peeta because I'm twisted like that ha! 5. 	   Peril that will leave you breathless.  This is what made me the most nervous to start the story.  I was terrified that my palms would never stop being sweaty or that my stomach would constantly be twisted in horror.  And I'm not going to lie, I was an emotional wreck.  I sobbed quiet a few times and it was hard to catch my breath at other times.  I never knew if there was ever going to be a break in the insanity that is their lives.  But when I read that final page, it was worth all of the emotional pain.  Because the story that unfolded, is one that will stick with me.  Even in the darkest moments of The Hunger Games, I was struck by the sincerity of some of their interactions.  Even when they were at their worst, people kept surprising me and gave me faith in humankind. So to all my friends out there that haven't read this, I beg you to take a chance.  You'll meet characters you love and find a story that will stay with you in your heart. And I'm already counting the seconds until I can pick up the second book.  Good luck, and may the odds be 
  ever
 in your favor. The Mockingjay used to make Anna’s picture can be found here.For more of my reviews, please visit:","Jun 11, 2014"
"9780439023481","4373","Bryan","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4373-bryan","Teen melodrama set against the backdrop of an evil, fascist state in which children are tortured and forced to kill for the entertainment of the masses. The moral implications of the protagonist's situation are not adequately addressed. The author lets Katniss off too easy, being too afraid of making her hero unsympathetic or showing the real emotional trauma and deep psychological scars she would have suffered. (Perhaps she does in the later books but I have no interest in reading them.) After the murder, killing, and torture it all comes down to teen love? Blech. Collins creates a very, very dark world and doesn't have the courage to deal with its consequences.You don't set a story in Auschwitz and then make it all about boys.EDIT: For the hell of it, I decided to write a longer review.The Moral IssueTo me the most interesting question of the book is how someone copes in a situation in which one is asked to kill innocent people to save one’s own life. Although I’m not entirely sure, my understanding is the major religions would prohibit such an action. In Collins’s story, though, this issue is almost completely side-stepped. It never crosses Katniss’s or anyone else’s mind that, although the government of Panem is clearly evil for having the Games in the first place, even the participants themselves are morally culpable for not resisting. The government will kill their family if they don’t play? OK, but isn’t it well-established in American and English common law, to say nothing of common sense morality, that duress and necessity are not defenses to murder?Katniss demonstrates no moral sense about what is being asked of her. She is a slave being asked to commit acts of pornography to gratify a decadent and sick public. Does she not resent being exploited this way? The scenes where the book really began to trouble me were during Katniss’s makeover and the interview before the games started. The argument can be made these scenes were meant to satirize reality TV, but I agree with those who say they instead seem to celebrate it.The person that bothered me the most during this part of the book is Cinna. He’s a disgusting human being, isn’t he? His job is to make these children attractive and beautiful before they’re sent off to slaughter each other, debased like animals. How does he sleep at night? How does he live with himself knowing that he is perpetuating such a system? What if his job was to make the girls pretty so they would look their best before being raped? Isn’t that what we have in this story, only worse?I began thinking about Cinna and the larger society that supports these games. I remember Collins saying that “everyone” watches the games. If true, that is not a society worth saving or caring about. Are you telling me there are no conscientious objectors? There is no protest movement? There is no peaceful or passive resistance? There are no parents who have instructed their children that, if chosen, they should refuse to play and that the family is willing to suffer the consequences to not be a part of such a vile pathology?If you think I’m taking this idea too seriously, look at how people reacted to the Kony video. Children kidnapped or pressed into fighting a war, and it becomes the fastest viral video perhaps ever.KatnissSome have described Katniss as “totally vicious” or “selfish, unsympathetic, and straight up awful.” Please. She is nothing of the sort. She is the hero we are clearly meant to admire and identify with. I don’t know if she’s vicious or awful because SHE’S NEVER ASKED TO MAKE ANY DIFFICULT DECISIONS.Her one act of bravery and sacrifice comes at the beginning of the story when she volunteers in her sister’s stead. After that, she must survive, but her character is never truly tested. Collins is too afraid of making her hero unsympathetic, she’s too afraid of alienating her readers, she wants too much to be liked, to push her heroine to the dark places such a situation demands. For example, killing Rue. Or killing Peeta. Or, mirroring her act of sacrifice to save her sister, by letting Peeta kill her. Instead, Rue is dispatched by one of the “bad” guys. Katniss only kills those who “deserve” it, i.e. the Career tributes. She is spared from having to kill anyone good.People, even children, are capable of far, far worse when the situation is sufficiently extreme. Take the story of Shin In Geun, who was born in and spent the first 23 years of his life in a North Korean prison camp. Indoctrinated by the state, when he was 13 years old he discovered his mother and brother were planning to flee the camp. Like a good North Korean, he informed the officials of their plan. Both were executed:“Execute Jang Hye Gyung and Shin He Geun, traitors of the people,” the senior officer said. Shin looked at his father. He was weeping silently. When guards dragged her to the gallows, Shin saw that his mother looked bloated. They forced her to stand on a wooden box, gagged her, tied her arms behind her back and a noose around her neck. She scanned the crowd and found Shin. He refused to hold her gaze. When guards pulled away the box, she jerked about desperately. As he watched his mother struggle, Shin thought she deserved to die.Shin’s brother looked gaunt as guards tied him to the wooden post. Three guards fired their rifles three times. He thought his brother, too, deserved it.The biggest issue Katniss faces? Which boy she likes.Story Problems 1.The sponsors are unnecessary. Given that the government can change the rules at will, and they control all aspects of the game, what do the sponsors get out of helping the kids? (Perhaps commercials. “That slit throat is brought to you by Coca-Cola.”) The main reason Collins includes the sponsors is to provide her weak storytelling with a deux ex machina. Whatever Katniss needs most periodically falls out of the sky. 2.But the most egregious problem is the rule change that allows both Katniss and Peeta to live. This is presented as one of the diabolical things the government does to mess with the contestants, but really it’s an easy way for Collins to provide a cheap plot twist and sustain the stupid Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle. Yes, the government changes the rule back, but it’s the laziest sort of manipulation.It’s my understanding that Collins, the daughter of a military officer, was trying to convey the experience of war. But it’s war as a video game with no real stakes, no real consequences other than whether the winner will be Team Peeta or Team Gale (which I assume is dealt with in the subsequent books).If you want a great story about children being forced into warfare, read Ender’s Game.","Mar 12, 2011"

I thought it started off good, but it lost impact as it went on. The premise was interesting, but there wasn't much justification behind it. It was like the author just wanted to write some book about a bunch of teenagers killing each other lord-of-the-flies style, but couldn't think of a good reason why the characters would be doing so. The explanation was really vague, like, ""The government is forcing people to do this because they want to ... show their power ..."" ??? Doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Also, after you read about a bunch of kids killing each other in horrible ways, it's just plain depressing. Then it gets boring and repetitive, after it keeps happening for like a hundred pages.I liked the emotional/romantic aspect of it. It was interesting. I thought it could've used a little more development, maybe, but it was cute.I guess my main issue with it was the plot, because it seemed to run out of plot about halfway through. It started falling into repetition ... and then the end was just WEIRD. *** spoiler **** and by that i mean the thing w/everyone turning into werewolves ... WTF was w/that??!! ***spoiler over****And, like, there's supposed to be a sequel? About what ... ? I mean, I guess there's a few details that could be worked out, but really it would've been better if they had been tied up in the end of the first book. Is the sequel worth reading? Yeah ...

"9780439023481","903390","Werner","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903390-werner","Note, September 5, 2015 --I edited this review just now to correct two misspelled words.For me, the extremely dark premise of this novel, as set out in the Goodreads description above, was a deterrent to reading it. While I'm a fan of brave heroines who can physically fight the forces of (adult) evil, the dynamic is different when the heroine we're asked to root for is thrown into an arena with 23 other 12-18 year old kids and told that only one can come out alive, all for the entertainment of adult sickos, and for the intimidation of their home districts. It's to Collins' credit as an author that she takes this premise and molds it into a tale that's profoundly morally conscious, and testifies to the strength of the human spirit and humane feelings. The book definitely does not pander to the tastes of the kind of people who would relish seeing (or visualizing) teens and pre-teens forced to kill each other. It does bring us face-to-face with gut-wrenching ethical questions. Would YOU volunteer to put yourself into that arena, to save a sibling? How far would you go to keep yourself alive in that setting? How far should you go? Would you take the lives of other innocents, who didn't want to be there any more than you do --but who will also be viewing you as someone who has to die if they're going to live? (Granted, not all these kids are so innocent --the Career tributes tend to be volunteers who like the idea of killing to win a life of wealth and ease; they're sadistic sociopaths now, who'd likely grow up to be adult sadistic sociopaths. But they're still kids at the moment, realistically shaped by a very brutal society.) Would you kill someone you genuinely like, who's not trying to hurt you? Would you kill someone who loves you? Someone YOU love? Could you accept your own death voluntarily, or even commit suicide? These questions aren't academic for Katniss, and fellow District 12 tribute Peeta. The thing that changes this book from the total downer it could have been to one that's in a real way uplifting is the fact that Collins' main characters, and some others, don't check their sense of decency and their humanity at the arena entrance; they try to retain both, and manage to display both, as a light against the pitch black darkness of the situation. ""I don't want them to change me in there,"" Peeta says at one point. ""Turn me into some kind of monster that I'm not."" At a fundamental level, this is a book about not becoming a monster, in the face of a social order that's out to make you one.That social order is another major theme of the book. We're looking here at a future America where the government is a completely self-serving law unto itself, which has subjects (not citizens) with, as far as it's concerned, no intrinsic rights, and which has no regard at all for human life as such; a society where inequalities of wealth and power are maintained by the vicious use of unrestrained force, and where the enormous resources of society are wasted on frivolous and even harmful projects while the working populace lacks basic medical care and is stalked by starvation. It's an America where dissent is criminalized and intimidated into silence, where the economic order is a dead-end of peonage and servitude for all but a few, with no hope of advancement, and where real human beings are simply grist for an entertainment industry that's all about manipulation and exploitation, without any concern for the human cost. An argument has been made to the effect that this novel isn't a true dystopian novel like 1984 or Brave New World because the people of Panem aren't that badly off (though I suspect they'd dispute that!), and because Collins supposedly doesn't clearly articulate what present-day trends she sees as setting the stage for this future. I would submit that every tendency described above is already present in our time in germinal form. If Collins doesn't explicitly articulate how pre-apocalyptic America --where the ultimate expression of these trends is restrained by (waning) morality, a vestigial Constitution and somewhat contested elections, even if they're manipulated-- devolves into her post-apocalyptic America where all restraints are removed, maybe it's because she prefers to let us connect the dots.For the type of plot and premise we have here, this isn't as grisly and gory as it could be; Collins shows us the ugliness and viciousness of the Games and their human cost, but she shows restraint in direct description, so that this doesn't become the ""pornography of violence"" the Capitol residents (and some of their present-day counterparts) revel in. There's no bad language or unwholesome sexual content. The writing is compulsively readable, a page-turner with no dull moments, and the situation and events make it one of the most evocative reads I've ever experienced --painful, harrowing, terrible and beautiful. Collins chooses to write through Katniss' eyes, in first-person present; this puts us right inside the protagonist's head and gives the narrative an immediacy that grabs you by the throat. To my surprise, it didn't feel gimmicky or awkward at all, but flowed like a stream --or, more accuately, a whitewater torrent!-- from the opening sentence. Katniss and Peeta are wonderfully realized characters, whom I found wholly believable, liked, admired and rooted for from the get-go.In the view of some of my Goodreads friends who've read the whole trilogy, the third book really pulls the entire series down, and ruins the portrait of Katniss that Collins constructed earlier. But be that as it may, this first book is, by itself, a powerful and compelling read that I would highly recommend.","Mar 19, 2012"

I'm a bit bothered by the lack of backstory of how Panem and the Hunger Games come about. It is just kind of explained away in a few paragraphs and we are left to accept this very strange world where teenagers are pitted into an arena each year to kill each other? I was expecting it because I've seen Battle Royale, but I would have appreciated knowing more of the backstory of how the world could have come into such a odd state.I suppose what makes a book like this interesting is thinking about the strategy of it all. The players are going to be statistically encouraged to band together because they will last longer that way, but by definition of course any partnership will be broken, and the drama of how that unfolds is always interesting and full of friendships broken and betrayal. Each character approached the game in their own way. Some banded together in larger coalitions, some were loners initially and banded together later. And some were just loners, like Foxface. A lot depended on your survival skill: could you find food and water on your own? Self-dependence is highly valued - and of course our hero was strong there.All in all, a fun read, but I feel kind of dirty for having read it.","Jan 13, 2010"

The book was so useless and poorly written it nearly broke my heart to think that this mediocrity is so popular. Well, let's do this:The decision to tell this book in both first person and the present tense is a gimmick to pull the gullible into a limping narrative that could not work in the past tense. This shoves the reader into a narrow, if not tiresome, pov that dispenses with what the rest of us call prose and employs rather a line by line in-progress description of events that never show us anything. We are told this boring story with little regard for environment, coloration, or even useful description that might be used to draw even the slightly intellectual reader into this lame excuse for a narrative. Oh, I know. The defenders will say, ""it's just a kids book. Don't you have an imagination?""I do. A big honken one. But there is some onus on the writer to make an effort at the suspension of my disbelief. I thought the Potter books were fantastic and well written. If you enjoyed this book, good for you. But let's not pretend that it is anything more than a Nickelodeon script writers lame attempt at real art. As art goes, it's a big FAIL.

It shows how much I got into it that I almost opted to not turn the tv on again at 10pm. Praise indeed Ms Collins. This has a simple storyline. Twelve divisions of a post apocalyptic country, defeated decades before in an attempt at revolution, are punished annually by a tribute. This monstrosity is to provide two children between the ages of 12 and 18, male and female, to fight it out in a battle to the death where only one of the 24 survives. This spectacle serves to remind the 12 oppressed states that they are under the rule of the 'Capitol', the ruling power. Our heroine takes the place of her beloved sister and ends up accompanying into this horror a young lad of her own age of whom she knows nothing except she begins to realize that he has flitted in the background of her life in a number of unobtrusive ways. Questions of trust, of truth, of fidelity to self and of preparadness to sacrifice fly back and forth. What is it to be real, to be genuine ? Is it more important to survive at all costs no matter what you give up to do so, or is the real you unalloyed goodness.This is not great literature in the sense that my great grandchildren, were I against all odds to gain some, are highly unlikely to be reading this but Collins has created a world which is horrendously believeable. A callous disregard for justice and compassion, a situation in which ratings and the visual are far more important than the twisted logic or vicious cruelty which went into their construction, a superficiality which can enable moodswings because of a pretty face or a heartstring tugging storyline..........sound familiar ? Collins has cleverly shone a light on stardom and celebrity and puerile shows in which the eating of a kangaroo's bollocks are seen as high drama and taken it far beyond what even those shows would envisage but she has left enough of the gaudy tackiness draped in soiled, tattered embarrassment to make her point.I found the story totally enthralling. Unusually for me I did not retch at the insertion of the inevitable 'love interest' purely because in Collins' story it was not inevitable. It was not the ridiculously badly written love at first sight crap ....yes Pittacus Lore, you know who you are....that is sometimes inflicted upon the unwary traveller. The two main characters were people you felt for and were rooting for. Collins managed to move me over the death of totally minor characters and the expressions of loving support that came each time Katniss showed her humanity and her kindness was genuinely startling.Does anymore need to be said.

After many recommendations from friends I trust, I bought the first book and read it in a couple of days. The concept of deadly competitive games in a dystopic society is not new, but Collins gives it a new spin, making comment on the society we live in where 'reality' television is devoured by couch potato viewers with little sense of what is real and what is orchestrated for the cameras. Some people have criticised the level of violence in the story but it's well-handled and never gratuitous. Without it we wouldn't get a true idea of the horrific scenario in which Katniss and Peeta find themselves. As a writer, I found much to admire in Collins' mastery of pace and tension in this story, and her ability to inject humour into very dark situations. I found Katniss a strong and interesting protagonist, but was not entirely convinced by her blindness to Peeta's true feelings (or her own feelings, for that matter.) I did enjoy The Hunger Games very much, but having peeked at the synopses of books two and three, I am not completely convinced that I will find them as satisfying. I hope Collins manages to keep the arbitrary changes of Games rules convincing. Will review again when I've read the second book.","Mar 20, 2012"

Often these types of stories fall into cliche, but the concept of revolution against an oppressive power starting within a system designed to maintain control is ingenious.I just watched Maze Runner (have not read the book) and was not impressed. Nor with Divergent. But this book, and the first movie, touched on deeper subjects.I think any totalitarian regime eventually fails. And government that has an elite with most of the resources has a built in failure. Because people are equal. I've heard that the concept of the games themselves was done in another book from Japan-- possible, but also, as a writer, I know every idea has been done. Not every story. The two are not the same. My wife and I, who write together, came up with the idea for Burners quite a while ago. The same basic concept of a regime tilted toward one small group, ruling over the masses. It could be with money, a system we see in our country now with most of the wealth clustered in less than 1% or, as we speculate in burners, in time-- what is worse than an inequality in lifespan?The very title of this book-- Hunger Games-- indicates that when one takes from another, you leave them hungry-- whether for food, freedom, or simply time.","Sep 26, 2015"

Once a year, in a dystopian future, an oppressive, ruling district randomly picks 2 kids, ages 12-18 from each district to compete in the Hunger Games, which is a battle to the death. 24 kids start, one survives and his/her district receives additional rations for a year. This year, Catnis's 12 year old sister is chosen who would surely be killed. Catnis volunteers to take her place and we fall in love with her. The boy chosen, Peta, has been secretly in love with her for years. Only one of the two of them can survive. No matter how Peta figures it, his relationship with Catnis must perish.Good: Collins sets up an interesting and convincing world of brutal oppression. Catnis is a great character and all of the people in the story are interesting. It's first person POV and we really do find Catnis likeable. It's hard to imagine a novel of teens killing one another to be palatable. This in itself is a major achievement. There are, of course, the villians (the oppressors) and the favored contestants (from districts 1 and 2), which makes Catnis an underdog. We like underdogs. We also like Catnis's skill at archery. Collins does a great job pitting Catnis and Peta against one another in a fight to the death in spite of the fact that Peta has loved her since he was very young. The people who live as aristocrats in ""the capitol"" come off as likeable, if affected, because they empathize with and try their best to support Catnis and Peta in this game to the death.A lot of the killings are inventive and Catnis is properly challenged beyond her abilities and is a winner. The plot moves well and the ending feels earned. This novel is a story of survival and Collins maintains that tension throughout. The intertwined love story is uncomplicated but interesting.Not as good: We don't see much soul searching on the page. The love story and issue of surviving is emotionally captivating. But a little more depth in Catnis would have put the cherry on top.Bottom line: You've probably already seen the movie. The novel is better than the movie although the movie is very faithful to the novel. I reread this novel to read a woman's first person POV for the purposes of the writing I'm doing. What surprised me is how well the novel holds up on second reading and after seeing the movie. So, it's a thumb's up!","Dec 22, 2015"

As much as that's what it centers around, that is not the purpose of the book.I respect this book, a lot even. I feel bad that I didn't give it a chance until I decided to read it. I brushed it off as if it was just another mainstream book, and expected it to be full of things I didn't want to read.But it wasn't, and I am so glad. No swearing, and no inappropriate scenes. It was clean.I have to say, as more and more popular the dystopian genre is becoming, this is quite a unique book.I didn't find it overly gory or disgusting, really, because come on, this is a book with lots of deaths and I expected it to be heavily described. I was prepared for that, though it didn't end up being that way very much. Some of the TV shows I watch are much more violent than this is, really.And like I said, as much as death is a central characteristic, the books aren't about the killing.Murder is NEVER portrayed as right. Neither Katniss nor Peeta ever want to kill anyone. Katniss is a girl with high morals. She's self-sacrificing. For goodness sake, she took her sister's place in The Games, and was absolutely ready to die for her. She sees the evil of the Capitol and hates it. She's modest and has a pure heart, and puts her family first before anything or anyone else.And although she doesn't love Peeta romantically in this book, he earns her begrudging respect. She learns what his love for her looks like, and doesn't intentionally take advantage of that - she grows to love him as a friend.I enjoyed this book because it blew my expectations away. I didn't know this before I started it, but THG is not about the killing. It's about doing what's right even if you could die for it. It's about making the most of what you've been given, and never giving up even when it's difficult.The writing was unique. Collins uses a lot of fragments in her writing, but it works. It's down-to-earth, and not stiff at all.I don't understand why people say that Katniss is cold. She cares deeply about her mother and her sister Prim. She cares about Gale and about Peeta, and Cinna, and Haymitch and Effie too. She's scared, yeah. But not for herself. She's scared for everyone that she would leave behind when she doesn't come back. But of course, she does come back. And they need her. It's not a Christian book, but it's still a good book. A book that I respect and will definitely read again.","Sep 25, 2015"

This is a YA...While reading this book, I was repeating that as a mantra to remind me that I have to be shallow (mababaw) so that my P759 (courtesy of my 13th month pay) would not go to waste. This book was recommended by a couple of a Filipino teens in our blog here in Goodreads as January's Book of the Month. I also heard 89.9 Magic's Mo Twister raving about this in his morning program as his book-for-the-holiday break. As I always listen to him in my way to the office in the morning, I did not want to be left out so what the hell, why not buy and read this book.It is a gripping and a edge-of-the-seat futuristic escapist novel. It rides in the current wave of reality shows. Think of the Survivor but the participants are teenagers (12 to 18 boys and girls) killing each other in the wilderness - forest, in the book's batch. That fighting in the forest readily reminded me of another fiction - historical, this time - that I read last year: Ken Follett's THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH (1996) and I liked it. It reminds me of our vacations in the barrio where we lived by eating the fruits and vegetables straight from our farm and we had no electricity so we either read books while the sun was still up late in the afternoon or play cards using a homemade kerosene lamp. Cool.Anyway, there's a handful reasons why this is not getting a five star: First, is the unbelievable plot. For example, Thresh letting go of Katriss. Collins made a good excuse by saying about ""owing"" and that Thresh, if he wins, will have to go back to District 11 and explain about killing Katriss at that point. He would be killing her later anyway, so what is the point? Second, is the corny beauty pageant show complete with floats, interview portion and makeup. Third, is the cheesy love story. It reminds me of the tiring Twilight love triangle. Fourth, is the fact that the Hunger Games is a sick reality TV show viewed by the whole country. What I cannot understand is how come the country (most of the districts cannot afford to feed their citizens) is so poor but the Capitol can afford to provide high tech TV screen that can be viewed even inside a cave and monitors even when Peeta was deep in the mud or when Rue was right on top of a tree? Lastly, the man and boys in the novel are morons and wimpy while the girls (Katriss, Rue, Foxface) all rock! Is this because the author is a woman and most reading population (according to statistics)are women?Anyway, enough of what I hate about the book. For entertainment value (I finished reading the book in 2 days even working 8 hours each in the office) it gave me, I already bought the 2nd book - CATCHING FIRE (o, savings will have to wait) and I will be reading this in the next few weeks. I cannot wait to find what happens next to Katriss and who she will be ending up with - Gale or Peeta. LOL.","Dec 26, 2009"

I loved it so much that I wrote about it in my undergraduate thesis. Looking back at all the dystopian YA books I have read so far, it's probably justifiable to say that The Hunger Games is an outstanding piece of literature.In my thesis, I utilized theories of Feminism to illustrate how Katniss is one of the most empowered females in dystopian YA. Compared to other girls like Tris Prior, Mare Barrows, or America Singer, Katniss is the perfect epitome of female empowerment. She does not care about her looks, she can overthrow powerful dictators, and she doesn't need a man to protect her or make her happy. Yes, she has a romantic connection with Peeta, but I believe that she would still be okay without him. Come to think of it, it's Peeta who needs Katniss. The dependence isn't actually mutual. In totality, Katniss will always be one of my favorite YA heroines in light of her political, romantic, and personal empowerment.The Hunger Games is also the work that perpetuated various dystopian YA elements, such as perpetual camera surveillance, class/caste divisions, and as deadly competitions rigged by the bourgeoisie. I've encountered ""Hunger Games Tropes"" in popular series like Throne of Glass, Red Rising, and more. I am often annoyed by this lack of originality in books nowadays, but as other people say, ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.""Overall, The Hunger Games holds a special place in my heart. It taught me the basics of what constitutes a dystopian novel, and it also set the standards for empowered YA heroines. In this regard, I wouldn't hesitate to call it a modern classic.","Apr 16, 2012"

Clearly there is nothing new to be said about this book that hasn't been said, but I don't need to express myself in words. This is what I thought of it:Plenty of people, particularly people closer to my age, in their twenties, don't care for this book, or say the one person POV is limiting, or they hate the addition of romance, or they hate the lack of romance, or etc etc, you've heard it all.I was not one of those people. Before this book, I was kind of sporadically reading books, a sort of rare occasion thing, and at the most I could do about 20 pages a night, but that was a stretch. But then I started reading this, and every single chapter left off with a reason to go on to the next one, and I found myself staying up til 2 in the morning with this book even though I had to be up by 7, and I just could not get over how entertained and on edge I was. And yes, I had been a long time fan of Battle Royale already, but this still felt like something fresh and special, more intimate. Ah well anyway. Just simply my sappy diatribe to explain that this is the book that made me want to READ books again. And I have not stopped my reading momentum since. Huzzah, huzzah, and huzzah to you, Katniss Everdeen.","Dec 29, 2010"

  “Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.”
I'm sure you don't need me saying it- this is more of a confirmation for myself really- but believe the hype.The Hunger Games has:• A badass and smart protagonist who stays true to her character through her awful situation• A plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat and reflects on many things wrong in our society and what could happen if we ever became a whole lot more monstrous.• A realistic survival story (except seriously when did these characters ever pee?)• A sweet male love interest. This could have easily blown up in the author's face- since a lot of writers when creating a nice-guy type of love interest often make his only attribute to be- well nice. They are not so much complex characters as a personality trait personified. This wasn't the case with Peeta. He had an edge that seperated him from the norm of failed cases.• Great characterisation of main and side characters- never making one into a monster. • A lot of backstory provided by Katniss that was definitely needed and appreciated.•All of the food. Eat Read this with a snack. You'll get hungry.As one of the latest people to read this- I declare it a winning dystopian novel.

Είναι άδικο όμως να το συγκρίνω με τα περισσότερα από αυτά, επειδή για τα περισσότερα από αυτά το «αγώνες πείνας» στάθηκε η βάση της δημιουργίας τους. Αυτό που μου έκανε εντύπωση στους αγώνες είναι η αφήγηση, διότι ενώ προτιμώ τα βιβλία δράσης να παρουσιάζονται από διάφορες οπτικές γωνίες ή από έναν παντογνώστη αφηγητή (για να μπορώ να βλέπω και να μαθαίνω τα πάντα :P ) εδώ ο μοναδικός αφηγητής είναι η Κάτνις και τα πάντα παρουσιάζονται μόνο μέσα από την οπτική της γωνία.

"9780439023481","4542979","Kim","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542979-kim","This is yet another novel which would not have come to my attention but for Goodreads and I would not have chosen to read it had it not been for the overwhelmingly positive reaction to the book of my Goodreads friends. I'm so glad that I did. For me, the most compelling aspect of the novel is what it says about our society. From the idea that rich and powerful people live on what is produced by poor people far away, to the concept of people being entertained by a reality television program the objective of which is survival at the expense of other contestants, to the depiction of a great “sporting” contest in which the success or failure of the contestants depends on their ability to attract wealthy sponsors, to the use of children killing other children as a weapon of control, these are all things that happen in the real world, right now. Certainly, the images are exaggerated*, but this only brings the reality of our world into sharper relief. I was engaged with the narrative from the very beginning. Although initially disappointed with Carolyn McCormick’s narration – I don’t think she does a great job with a number of the characters - I left my irritation with the narrator behind and fully entered the world of the novel. The details of the world are clever. For example, the depiction of the relationship between the Capitol and the Districts as akin to the relationship between ancient Rome and its empire is simply but effectively achieved by calling children who are sent to the Capitol to fight to the death in the Hunger Games “tributes” and by giving the Capitol’s inhabitants Latin names. Collins has also done well with the development of her characters. The novel is narrated by the sixteen-year-old heroine, Katniss Everdeen to whom Collins gives a very believable voice. Katniss is prickly, sullen and quite clueless about her own emotions, but she is smart, loyal and resourceful. It is interesting to watch her grow from resigned acceptance of the system in which she lives in general and of the Hunger Games in particular, to clarity about what those things represent, culminating in her light bulb moment, (view spoiler)[ when she refers to the killing at the Hunger Games by its correct name - murder (hide spoiler)]. Other characters are also well realised. This is particularly true of Haymitch, the alcoholic mentor and former Hunger Games champion, who shows the classic signs of a veteran with combat stress reaction. Successfully pulling off a first person, present tense narrative is no easy feat, given that the point of view has to remain solely that of the narrator. Collins achieves this without faltering. While Katniss speculates about what she can’t see and doesn’t know, the perspective remains hers. Even within the limitations imposed by this narrative style, Collins is able to let the reader know more than her heroine is aware of. As is to be expected from the subject matter, the novel contains graphic descriptions of violence. However, there is nothing about this which either encourages or glorifies violence - quite the contrary. The horrific situation in which the participants in the Hunger Games find themselves speaks for itself. Making choices in situations of adversity, friendship, loyalty and above all, what it means to be human are what the novel is really about.Overall, I found this audiobook riveting to listen to. The only reason I’m glad not to have read the book when it was first published is that I can go on to the second volume of the trilogy without delay. *There is no exaggeration in relation to the issue of children killing children. The plight of child soldiers has had a lot of exposure in social media in recent times. A friend of mine who works for the United Nations was posted in Uganda a few years ago, where his task was to re-unite child soldiers from the Lord’s Resistance Army with their families and communities. The sheer horror of what those children experienced trumps any fictional account of violence committed by and against children.","Mar 23, 2012"
"9780439023481","18450298","Sonia","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18450298-sonia","Lo estuve leyendo de nuevo y no pude evadir el recurrente (y muy persistente) pensamiento de que este libro habría sido maravilloso si lo hubiesen escrito en tercera persona y no desde la perspectiva de Katniss Everdeen.Todo el tema de la rebelión me parece muy interesante y de hecho no puedo decir que el libro no me haya gustado, fue de esos libros con los que, si mal no recuerdo, me introduje en el mundo de la ciencia ficción y el género YA.La razón por la que pienso que este libro habría sido mejor en tercera persona es por la subjetividad de Katniss. Puedo entender que de vez en cuando sea retraída y no se pueda dilucidar mucho sobre su personalidad, pero en ocasiones es más que eso, es como un resentimiento casi infundado y un miedo que la lleva a rechazar a quienes tiene más cerca y no nos permite ver cómo son realmente las personas de su entorno más que como ella las pinta, lo cual no es suficiente. Ese comportamiento no me gustó, el hecho de que estuviera siempre a la defensiva se ganó mi recelo pese a su determinación como persona. Era fuerte, pero no lo suficiente como para llevar ese peso en sus hombros porque le faltaba llenar muchos aspectos. Creo que visto desde fuera, así como lo he visto en la película, resulta un poco menos fastidioso.El romance no fue solo un poco fastidioso. Fue horriblemente molesto. Katniss se miente a sí misma y solo piensa en su familia, pero el que Peeta y Gale estén enamorados de ella le trae sin cuidado o peor, cree que (en caso de Peeta) es todo una farsa. Pues mira, en mi opinión eso estuvo de más, el amor se me hizo un poco falso y creo que va cogiendo intensidad a fuerza de necesidad, porque Katniss no parecía muy por la labor.No se explotó lo suficiente a los personajes y creo que esa es otra consecuencia de construir un libro en tercera persona. El problema es que me pareció que este era un libro sobre una adolescente con el corazón endurecido que es forzada a ir a unos tales juegos del hambre, en lugar de una adolescente que se ve atrapada en los juegos del capitolio y que ocasionalmente cae en el enredo del romance joven. El triángulo amoroso sobra. Sobra. Sobra.Y los temas de los que se debió hablar más, son los que abarcan como tres páginas a lo sumo. La chica se sumergió demasiado en su odio hacia lo superficial, así que cayó en lo mismo que el resto.No todo es odio para Katniss. La chica sabe cómo arreglárselas por su cuenta y el amor hacia su familia es impresionante. Es fuerte, es decidida y va a por su objetivo (a pesar de que se deje otras cosas importantes por fuera). Lo que me gustó de ella es que no se parece en absoluto a las protagonistas de otros libros y puede valerse por sí misma. El problema es que no se deja querer, y eso le cierra muchas puertas.La trama en sí es fascinante, y creo que por eso le doy cuatro estrellas. Como controlan todo a favor de los juegos y no de las personas, como las personas se ven obligadas a cambiar para sobrevivir y todo el tema de la rebelión me pareció excelente. No puedo explicar cómo la construcción de los juegos en sí me dejó absolutamente pasmada, la crueldad con la que el capitolio ejerce su poder me asqueó y me sorprendió en ocasiones, y puedo ver que este libro es como una plataforma para lo que se viene después.","Apr 28, 2014"

Katniss is a 16 year old girl who lost her father at his work and has a never-there-for-her type of mother for herself and her sister,Prim and only has 1 friend,Gale. Peeta is a 16 year old boy who comes from a family with both of his parents and brothers and sisters, he's considered popular at his school and works at his family backery. Every year there is a reaping for a girl and a boy to fight for their life out of the 12 districts to be the only one living out of the 24 tributes selected. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are the tributes for district 12 and figured that they won't win without each other. Right before they sacrifice their own life so they don't have to live without each other they are rewarded the victors of the 74th Hunger Games.This book is well written out. When I was reading this book I could tell how the characters were feeling and could picture in my head what all was going on. This book is by far one of my favorite books that I have ever read.

The first time I read these books was in 2014. I devoured all three in less than a week and have since watched the movies countless times. I don't even want to talk about how psyched I am for November and Mockingjay part 2. But this is my first time revisiting the books since that first read last year. I'm glad I slowed down on this readthrough. It's a great story with suspense that is beyond addicting, but between being insanely busy IRL and wanting to take the opportunity to make sure I didn't miss anything, this was as great the second time as it was the first. The things that stood out so much to me last year remain bold this time around; the sense of continuity in Katniss' and Peeta's wounds, the sense of urgency, the excellent characterizations. I love seeing the world specifically through Katniss' eyes, even though the movies open the world up a bit more. The original books bring a quality of depth that the movies don't have, no matter how many times you watch them. Incidentally, I discovered while reading that this edition of the trilogy is the UK version xD words like ""programme"" and ""colour"" tipped me off, and I'll probably go back to my American trilogy the next time I pick the series up, but I LOVE these covers <3","Dec 06, 2014"

"9780439023481","3655732","Clare Cannon","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3655732-clare-cannon","This review will probably not be popular, but it's good to talk about these issues. It is taken from a longer article written for Mercatornet http://www.mercatornet.com/articles/v...War, persecution, abuse, suffering -- these are common themes in literature and I am not overly disturbed by them, at least in principle. Dark themes are a part of life, and even if they are difficult to face they can be invaluable for testing character, proving virtue, and drawing out what is most beautiful in human nature, as well as the worst. It all depends how they are dealt with.In a dystopian vision of the near future, Hunger Games is a terrifying reality TV show where twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to compete to the death. The Capitol has imposed the games on the children of the twelve districts under its control to remind them that rebellion is futile. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her sister’s place, and though she sees it as a death sentence, she is determined to survive for the sake of her family.Author Suzanne Collins conceived the idea for Hunger Games while channel surfing between reality TV shows and news coverage of an actual war zone. It is not a particularly uplifting theme, yet Collins has many readers convinced that the book’s ethics are clear: it is a critique of the violent injustice it describes. I am not convinced.SurvivalIn the games, survival is the ultimate good and death the greatest evil; our heroine never questions this. She and the other characters do whatever it takes to survive, and for games contestants this means killing. Katniss is the good girl so she is subtle at first, dropping an insect nest on someone’s head so they swell up and die ""naturally"", or destroying another group’s food so they will starve. Her district companion Peeta confesses that “to murder innocent people costs everything you are”, yet indirectly and later directly, both he and Katniss still do it.The experience is like reading a first hand account of a Nazi soldier doing horrible things to others in order to stay alive. The fact is, sometimes survival is not the most important thing and it is necessary to be prepared to die rather than kill someone else.In Collins’ books, survival only loses its appeal when suffering makes death more appealing than life, justifying the suicide and mercy killing which are rife in the series. Towards the end the rebels—including Katniss—carry a suicide bomb in case they or their friends are caught. Failure to kill a captured friend is seen as a failure of friendship, and Katniss’ reluctance to use it is a sign of her weakness. Darkness–1; Characters–0.Desensitisation and “romance”Next there is brutal desensitisation so the characters won’t get so hurt (it is not acknowledged that this too is a form of harm), and romance used as a tool of survival.The games are televised and sponsors must be sought to provide the food and medicine contestants will need to survive. Body appearance is therefore important: each contestant has a stylist who must first assess them without clothes (Katniss ‘bravely’ resists the urge to cover herself), and then a full body wax makes them camera-ready. This is probably normal for reality TV, but don’t tell me it’s brave.At first, the other contestants mock Katniss with explicit offers and gestures because she is so ""pure"". But soon she ""toughens up"" and is able to laugh rather than blush at their provocative displays, and shows less of a concern to protect herself. As Katniss is ""built up"" (broken down), Collins seems to enjoy describing the loss of innocence; it’s quite nauseating.From the start, a fake relationship between Katniss and Peeta is played up to win sponsorship. ""One kiss equals one pot of broth"", so Katniss maintains a star-crossed lovers’ routine with long, lingering kisses and imaginary tears, and later the pretence that they are married and that she is pregnant.Peeta himself falls for it, but Katniss is just confused about what she feels. This doesn’t stop her from kissing, hugging and ""comfort' bed sharing with Peeta, nor prevent her kissing her old friend Gale ""to make up for all the kisses I’ve withheld, because it doesn’t matter anymore, and because I’m so desperately lonely I can’t stand it."" This petty, selfish, mockery of love is all that is served up in Hunger Games.Not only did Katniss embrace her progressive desensitisation and confusedly false romance, but the book makes her a hero for it. Darkness–2; Characters–0.Feelings replace right and wrongNow to ethics per se. Actions are deemed right or wrong based on how the characters feel about them. For Katniss the pattern is repeated over and over: a catastrophic situation is followed by her passionate but often unethical reaction, then a soul-searching analysis of her feelings to deal with her guilt, followed by defiant justification that she had no choice, or, if she had a choice, that she was confused, which is the fault of those who created the catastrophe. Thus she becomes the victim-hero: none of the evil—including that which she did herself—is her fault: they made her do it.Is there not a little duplicity in someone who curses the horrible culture that sacrifices its children to settle its differences, when she herself has played along with it the whole time? Darkness–3; Characters–0.“Heroic rebellion”Some may claim that Katniss did rebel. First, her fake romance: What is rebellious or heroic about this self-serving tactic? Second, Katniss' and Peeta’s threat of double suicide to demand that they both be allowed to live: after killing so many others her effort to spare a friend rings hollow. Third, her placing of flowers on her dead friend’s body: but then she goes on to continue the games, fighting and killing…What about the grand finale where Katniss joins the rebels to bring down the Capitol? Running on hatred, bitterness and revenge, the rebels use bombs and guns to kill hundreds of innocent citizens who get in the way. Katniss may not like the large-scale killing, but she has no problem shooting a startled citizen who blocks her path. Still, we are reassured, it’s not her fault. Darkness–4; Characters–0.SensationalismReinforcing all the above is the seductive sensationalism of the storytelling. It is like watching a graphic news story that turns horrific events into entertainment, using excessive detail and twisting the narrative to wrench every possible emotion from the viewer, constantly driven to bigger and better shocks for impact. The screaming, the blood, the broken bodies, the instruments of torture and the damage they do -- when all this is no longer enough the emotional impact of the slow and graphic death of some poor, innocent character we’ve come to like is thrown in. I don’t know how on earth the movie will rate PG.How can this series be a critique of using injury and death for entertainment when it does the same itself?! Thanks to the gratuitous graphic detail not only the characters, but the readers too, are damaged. Darkness–5; Characters (and readers)–0.So, what do we do now?Readers should question the lack of freedom and responsibility of these characters. Could they have chosen to act differently? Are they responsible for choosing to act badly? Would we be right to do the same in their situation? Are they heroes for acting as they did? If there is still confusion, ask the same questions about Nazi soldiers.Also think about the effect of turning horrible things into entertainment. Parents may find some helpful analysis of the effect of desensitisation on our ability to love in Wendy Shalit’s shocking book A Return to Modesty: Discovering the Lost Virtue (1998).It will also help to look at alternative novels. Birthmarked (2010) by Caragh M. O’Brien is a recent favourite of mine. Though it’s also dystopian and deals with dark themes in a cruel future world, the beauty of characters’ actions transforms the story completely.The heroine, Gaia, is an ordinary person who must learn from failures and struggle to face her fears. Flash-backs to her childhood show that her parents’ depth and wisdom nourished her character so that she was ready to face difficulties with courage and selflessness. At one point her mother has doubts about something she did in obedience to the government. Gaia would excuse her for not having had a choice but her father corrects her: “You always have a choice, Gaia, you can always say no”. The story shows that the consequences of such a choice are not always pleasant, but sacrifice for what is right is a triumph of good over evil, which is far more heroic than doing evil for fear of getting hurt.Gaia’s own actions are true acts of rebellion: she risks her life by refusing to save herself before trying to save her parents; she saves a baby from dying along with its condemned mother; she rescues her mother and the child she is carrying... And when she is called to leave one victim for someone who needs her more, she is not governed by feelings but by trying to do what is right.The romance is realistic but perfect: the characters’ love for each other grows for all the right reasons. They learn so much about each other and their flawed but earnest characters are the antithesis of Edward/Bella sentimentally and Katniss/Peeta falseness. What’s more, they demonstrate very real sacrifice; there is no better sign of love.Somehow in the midst of evil’s triumph, sacrifice for what is good produces a hope that is even stronger than the evil that weighs upon it. Thus the characters are victorious, even when the darkness seems to have the upper hand.The style may not be as slick and addictive as in Hunger Games, and perhaps a lazy reader’s initial reaction may be that it’s not as good, but the characters positively shine by comparison. It’s worth thinking about the after-effect of books once the action fades and characters and story settle in your soul. That’s the part that stays with you.Another alternative is The Book Thief (2006) by Markus Zusak. In this interview the author describes the beauty of human goodness which can be discovered in the midst of great evil.There are so many more great novels which explore dark or difficult themes but clearly show protagonists taking responsibility for their actions. Trash by Andy Mulligan (2010), The Hiding Place by Corrie Ten Boom (1971), The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas by John Boyne (2006), The Scarlet Pimpernel by Emmuska Orczy (1903), A Rose for the ANZAC Boys by Jackie French (2008), Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford (2009), The Help by Kathryn Stockett (2009, mature readers), Anne Frank: the Diary of a Young Girl (1947), Sophie Scholl and the White Rose by Annette Dumbach (1999, mature readers), Amazing Grace: William Wilberforce and the Heroic Campaign to End Slavery by Eric Metaxas (2007), Left to Tell by Immaculee Ilibagiza (2006, mature readers), St Maria Goretti: in Garments all Red by Godfrey Poage (1998), Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl (1946), Life Without Limits by Nick Vujicic (2010).Read and compare, and decide who the real heroes are.","May 13, 2010"

Perhaps I have some latent bloodlust lurking somewhere in my psyche. Comparisons to Takami's  Battle Royale (and the cult film adaptation by Fukasaku) are inevitable. The dystopian conceit -- a corrupt government punishing its citizens by sentencing children to fight each other to death in a public spectacle -- is almost exactly the same in Hunger Games. However, I guess it is hard to find a story that doesn't remind you of another story. Still...hmmm, Suzanne Collins, hmmm.Hunger Games provides a nice update to the Battle Royale idea and is a perfect fit for teenagers who have grown up in the era of The Real World and The Hills. I caught the first episode of Real World Season 283 a few years back and was struck by how stale it had become. Producers must be hard pressed to find show applicants who haven't seen the first 200 seasons, so the kids who show up are so meta its ridiculous. On the first day, two girls started making out in the hot tub while wondering who among the guys they had just met must be the token gay character. (Show editors must be tearing their eyes out in hopes of any legitimate story arcs). Hey, look at me, I'm so outrageous!Of course, there is more at stake in the Hunger Games arena than in the Real World house of debauchery. What most interested me in this book was how heroine Katniss used her accumulated knowledge of the Hunger Games, having watched it every year growing up, to manipulate her status and progress in the games. She is aware at every moment that she is on camera and does her best to use this knowledge as a weapon -- one arguably more effective than her skill with a bow and arrow.Katniss's first person narrative gives the story its immediacy and sense of excitement; however, I actually feel that this sole perspective limited the complexity of the book. It would have been fascinating to have also had Haymitch's perspective or perhaps some behind-the-scenes gamemaker's interpretation of events. Finally, it cannot be denied that the book ended REALLY abruptly. I know it is the first of the series, and yes I am left wanting more, but this book felt really unbalanced. I am more impressed when books in a series both work together and also stand alone as complete works.Still, sign me up to read the next one! Get cracking, Suzanne!","Dec 04, 2008"

I had to do my first one for The Hunger Games because it really was the catalyst that started me reading again. I initially heard about the book when I saw the teaser trailer for the movie. If you don't remember the first set of teaser trailers then I'll remind you that it was pretty sparse. It had someone running through the forest ,fire and then finally a emblem of a bird on fire. It intrigued me but I did nothing about it. Then , while away on vacation, I came across the book for the first time. Funnily enough it didn't have the cover sleeve so I didn't know it was called The Hunger Games but it had the symbol of that bird and I remembered seeing it before. I laid out on the beach with this book in tow totally unaware of what I was about to get into. I mean I read mostly romance novels before this book and it had been a long time since I picked up anything new. I also had never read a dystopian type novel before so I really had no idea what the story was going to be about. I opened the book and began to read it until I could fall asleep in the sun but that did not happen. The way the character Katniss spoke in the 1st chapter and the way she described her life in Panem was incredible. When she described what the Hunger Games were exactly I was shocked, alarmed, furious, sad, intrigued and confused . I had never experienced so many emotions in one chapter of a book ever. I literally read the first chapter a second time just to make sure in understood the setting of this series. I then thought that there is no way that this book was made for youth between the ages of 9-12 . I never read anything so adult at those ages. It truly is a master piece. I was so wrapped up in this book that by the end of my vacation I came home and ordered the whole trilogy via Amazon just so I could finish it. It truly was a moving series and this book was the one that started my journey into other dystopian novels. If you have ever even thought about reading this book for even a minute then you have deprived yourself for far to long. Don't hesitate and just jump. This book , the whole series , is a ride you don't want to miss. Enjoy ;)","Feb 10, 2013"

I loved it!I feel the author came up with a fresh story idea. Sometime in our distant future, our country is destroyed and 12 districts are born, to form a nation called Panem. The lower the district number you have seems to mean you are more fortunate. The higher districts live in extreme poverty. They have little food or possessions. A teenager, Katniss, has been doing the hunting for her mother and young sister for 4 years since her father’s death in a mine explosion. She’s lived a very harsh life in district 12People also live in fear of The Capitol. They can take you out at any time, and destroy your family or even your entire district. You can’t speak out against them or you will be punished. Every year they have a ceremony that is called The Reaping. They put names off all teens from ages 12 – 18, from all the districts and pick two ‘Tributes’ from each district. These Tributes must go to the Capitol and fight to the death in what is called The Hunger Games. Only 24 Tributes go in, and one will survive. They are put into an outdoor environment that is created by the Gamemakers, and have to survive harsh conditions, attacks by other Tributes, attacks by Gamemakers. The games are televised 24/7 for Panem to watch. I don’t want to give much away, but Katniss takes the place of her younger sister as a Tribute for District 12. The story is really fast paced, and it turns into a nail-biter at the end. I highly recommend this read! I cannot wait to pick up the second in the series.","Feb 25, 2010"

Right, I thought, this is going to be strange. But it was great. I loved it from beginning to end, from the great start to the breathtaking finish. I finished it in two days (I had to!) and then looked frantically for the second. It's hard to put down, and impossible to forget. Even after the final page, you think about it for days. The prose is flowing and easy to read. The characters are reality at its finest -- though with so many twists to their personalities you will never fully figure them out, not even at the end. Every concept in the novel is amazing. The detail is sparse but vivid. The action is never ending (each chapter ending with words that make you keep going) and there's not chance for a break.

Katniss is a very strong and likeable protagonist, and while the concept did seem a little too similiar to ""The Running Man"", Collins still added enough original ideas to make it her own. The book is divided into three parts, and while I loved the first two, I did feel it started to collapse under its own weight in the third part. Without getting specific, I'll just say that I thought the fates of some of Katniss's opponents were rather anti-climactic (one in perticular that caused me to yell out ""That's it??? Really???)

The problem with hype like that is it sets unrealistic expectations for me. As I sat down to finally read the book, I hoped I could separate the hype from the reality and judge the book on its own merits.And it is a good book. It's not ground-breaking but it's still quite good and a novel twist on the classic short story, ""The Most Dangerous Game."" In the near future, the former United States has been divided into 12 territories. Each year, tributes are selected from each territory to compete in the hunger games, a kind of brutal post-apocalyptic version of ""Survivor."" The winner gets to live and wins fame, fortune and food for his or her district. Our heroine, Katsiss volunteers for the role when her younger sister is selected. She's whisked away to the Capitol to train and then to compete, along with the son of a baker from her district. The two create a splash in the Capitol as they are introduced to the nation and prepare for the games.As an exercise in world-building, the first half of the novel is fascinating. Suzanne Collins gives us enough glimpses of the society she's created without hindering or taking away from the plot. The observations by the first-person narrator of Kat help the reader begin to slowly identify with her and offer up some criticism of the society as a whole. It's really once the game itself begins that things take a step backward. There is some suspense to the game, the pursuit and some twists and turns along the way. But the book loses some of its early momentum when Kat is turned loose in the game. Hearing about her strategy is interesting at first but given that this is first-person narrated story there's not much question who will win the game. Thankfully Collins gives us a twist that covers this, defying reader expectations. All of that said, I found myself wishing that this story was embraced more than a certain other series about shiny vampires. It's a better written story, better executed and shows more promise in one novel than that series has in four. It's not terribly new or ground-breaking but it's still a good story, well told.","Aug 01, 2009"

I am not normally a fan of YA (Harry Potter is not YA, you shut up!), but decided to read this one anyway. I expected a fluff read where I would roll my eyes often. I have to say that I am honestly surprised by how well-written this book was.I don't see any point in going into the plot particulars; there are many reviews here that do that. But I would like to mention some of the things I loved about The Hunger Games.1.) The first chapter is packed so full of important information, and it is artfully and wonderfully done. The reader gets all the necessary background on Panem, the Hunger Games, the Reaping, Katniss and her family, and her friendship with Gale.2.) Although there were places where the book lagged a bit (days of Katniss sitting in trees during the games without any tribute deaths), those were few and far between. For the most part, this book hooked me early and kept me interested the entire time.3.) The heroine isn't your typical heroine. She is surly and distrusting. She really isn't even very likable. But she makes no excuses for that and continues on.4.) The ""love story"" isn't a love story. In fact, there is zero love on Katniss's part. Her goal is to get out of the games alive, preferably saving Peeta, too. Her motivation has nothing to do with romance, and that's nice for a change. 5.) The games brought out a hatred of The Capitol in Katniss, setting up the possibility of sequel books. Although this book would have worked just fine on its own as a single, it's usually a good idea to hook the reader into thinking of the continuation of a great story at a future time. The author did a fantastic job of this.All in all, I have to say that this book went way beyond my expectations, and I think I loved it. I am a fan of Katniss, and a fan of Peeta for completely different reasons. I will definitely read the other books in the series.","Feb 07, 2016"

She does an awesome job of developing her characters and wrapping them around a story line that has you captivated the whole way through! I fell in love with Katniss, Peeta and Gale immediately, and my heart went out to them as they faced their struggles and challenges throughout the book. I love this book and would recommend it without hesitation!","Nov 24, 2008"

The characters are beautifully developed and the setting is eerie (too real and too plausible). At first I thought it the dystopian society would be hard to believe, but Collins really sells it. I was with her from beginning to end. By the way, I cried at two scenes and nearly had a heart attach at a couple others. I read tons of books and for me that experience is very rare.

I have given up on doing that, and decided that my life is better spent looking for books that are not torturous to read.  Romance of the Three Kingdoms is looking pretty good to me.But I do want to raise one question about this book's mind-blowing popularity, because it's really that part that I have never been able to wrap my mind around. Twilight has an entire audience that hates it to death and is regularly targeted for being sexist and badly written. Even Harry Potter has received its fair share of criticism for technical shortcomings. Eragon is frequently derided for its lack of originality. Yet when a book comes along with the thinnest pretense of ""feminism,"" it immediately escapes all scrutiny and is lauded not only for being empowering to women, but also a quality piece of literature?How is it possible that a book about 24 children fighting to the death is more famous for its love triangle than the way it deals with how one would lose their fucking humanity in a situation like that? How is it possible that this book's protagonist possesses almost zero agency and embodies almost every sexist cliche that comes with ""strong woman,"" yet is smugly compared to Bella Swan as the real example of a feminist role model? How is it possible that what is really a high school romantic drama dressed up in dystopian clothing receives such critical acclaim? Is it because popular culture wants to believe that only the most superficial appeals to feminism are the end-all-be-all to deconstructing patriarchy? Is it because middle-class readers like to equate their everyday pain with people who starve to death and are oppressed by a totalitarian regime? Katniss is essentially a spoiled middle-class American teenager, just like Bella Swan is, but the only difference is that she's got a bow and arrow and some dirt.This is a book that panders to people. I do not mean to say that fans of this book are unintelligent or did not take valuable things away from it, but I do think that Collins is taking advantage of very convenient cultural trends to write a book that many people find safe to praise. As The Last Psychiatrist points out, Katniss's character is praised for having traits that any decent human being would have, in accordance with the popular idea that what makes a man normal would make a woman special. More interestingly, I wonder what were Collins's intentions behind this book. Did she write in Katniss's ""I'm-the-center-of-the-world"" attitude because kids fighting to the death is not dramatic enough? Or does she want to appeal to readers by pretending to deal with heavy themes like starvation, war, and survival but also write a romance at the same time?But my biggest question is: how do people not see through this? Perhaps I'm overestimating the accuracy of my own subjective experience with this book, but I find it hard to believe that so many people could have missed the complete lack of moral ambiguity that would inevitably pop up in this kind of story, how most of the important people in Katniss's life are men, how all the non-Katniss female characters have no real emotional lives. Is it that all we look for in literature are superficial markers? Is that what feminism means to us, just looking for things that fit a preconceived notion of feminism? Are our attempts to understand third-world suffering really just a narcissistic way to convince ourselves that the rest of the world is just like us?I've exerted every possible effort I can to understand. I've tried forcing myself to like this book, and have reread it multiple times. I've talked to many of my friends who love The Hunger Games. I've read countless positive reviews of this, hoping to find something to convince me that I'm wrong, because that would please me more than anything. So far I have not. I am willing to believe that Collins's other books may be well-written, as pretentious writing tends to be very deliberate, but for now, it's going to take a loooooong time for the bitter aftertaste of this to dissipate. (And it's already been years since I first read it.)Hmm. I said earlier I wouldn't tear this book to shreds. Does questioning the trends of popular culture count as tearing this book to shreds? Anyway, feel free to disagree. Although I know this review does little to help my case, I promise I am not as immature I was four years ago.__________ETA: I recently found this amazing blog post that articulates the problems with portrayals of gender in THG as well as popular culture more eloquently than I could ever do myself. Please do read it--I think it raises so many oft-ignored crucial issues about sexism (and racism) in media , the self-awareness of which we would all benefit from greatly._________Apparently I am incapable of refraining from criticizing this book. I'm doing my best to keep the vitriol out of my tone because I don't wish to discourage disagreement with my opinions, but I can't deny that this book seems more and more awful every time I think about it. Anyway, I feel obliged to note that the portrayal of poverty and economic disparity in this book is atrocious. Living on the edge of survival, contrary to what Collins may think, does not make you ""stronger"" or ""better"" than those of the upper classes. Poverty is extremely degrading. It wears down on people and saps them of their ability to find meaning in their lives and is often the source of huge mental health issues. This whole idea is also just seriously illogical. Think about it: rich people have access to food, education, healthy exercise, as well as strong social networks and family structures that provide stability as kids grow up. Poor people have to work themselves to death to bring in the most meager of incomes, raise families at the same time, struggle with food, limited access to education, get shamed for their problems by the upper classes for being ""lazy,"" and often with no hope of the situation ever changing, stuck in an endless cycle of never having enough. Which of these two categories do you think is likely to turn out more successful?The only circumstance for being ""proud"" of a poor economic background is when you finally escape it and can look at the situation from the outside, comparing it to the better situation you have now. Fetishizing poverty is nothing less than utterly insulting to the millions of people in the world actually living in poverty, whether in 1st world or 3rd world countries. It frustrates me to think that readers of The Hunger Games will take one look Katniss's situation and applaud her for her middle-class snobbery because it affirms their expectations of ""female strength."" No. It's not inspiring that Katniss overcame starvation and it would have been equally valid, perhaps even more so, if it was a source of anger and shame rather than pride. It's horrible that she, as well as all the citizens of the districts, had to suffer this oppressive regime bullshit in the first place, and I cannot condone Collins's black-and-white portrayal of the Capitol as a bunch of empty-headed puppies and the oppressed population as pure and innocent angels. Nor does she ever develop, in reliably consistent depth, precisely how the totalitarian regime of Panem works; one minute the Capitol authorities are evil overlords, the next minute they're slaves to the entertainment whims of the Capitol population, so even one of the most basic premises of the world of Panem--the idea that the Capitol citizens are subjugated to the political authority--doesn't work as an excuse for Collins's lousy social commentary.__________And again I find myself unable to stop. The reception of The Hunger Games is often based on praise for conservative romantic views regarding Katniss, Peeta and Gale...compared to all those slutty YA female characters with normal teenage urges, I suppose. For one thing, conservative sexual tendencies is largely an upper class thing; there's a reason why teenage pregnancies are stigmatized in industrialized countries but not in poorer nations, after all. If Katniss is sexually suppressed because it's just her individual personality, then that is some extremely sloppy world building on Collins' part, because it prevents us from seeing her as a product of her society if that society isn't influential enough to shape such a basic and fundamental part of her worldview. Second, to laud a book because it agrees with popular political views is not a convincing argument for a piece of literature's quality. This shows some serious prejudice in media that our preferences are tilted towards stories that reinforce our social opinions regardless of whether they hold any weight. What does it matter if Katniss is a good role model if her portrayal is so anachronistic and inaccurate that it undercuts the environment she comes from (which is supposed to be some sort of insightful commentary on third world environments and the social/political/cultural consequences and circumstances of those environments?) Such a narrow portrayal of such weighty issues is surely a far more grievous error when writing to children than any submissive housewife like Bella Swan could ever be.","Mar 24, 2013"

  One of the best book series i've read. Great job Suzanne Collins :DWhen you love and hate something in a book with ALL your heart you realize how great that book really is, because it has to be really special for you to get to feel all these mixed feelings and still say that it deserves not only 5 stars, but .. 7.. or 10. The story is so complex, the characters are so well developed, the new world created by the author is absolutely fascinating, described so well and it seems so real it scares me, because is not the future I would like for human kind and it seems so possible. Suzanne Collins did an amazing job in writing this books which captivates you from the first pages in such manner that you can't let them go until you reach the very ending.The story is constructed around a young girl, Katniss Everdeen, who all her life tried to protect her family at all costs and now she must do the last thing she can do to keep her little sister safe: die in the hunger games..
  Well, you must be prepared because this is such a powerful story. It takes you in a carousel of emotions and the adventure so great that it makes you dizzy from the speed and all the sudden changes, and the insecurity of not knowing who the enemy is or who you could trust.There is something that really made me fall in love with the ""hunger games"", the fact that the characters seem so REAL.. they are scared, they make mistakes, they don't know who to trust or not, they cry for the loved ones, they are so strong in some ways and so week in the others. Also then the dialog feels so real, the descriptions are amazing, everything is revealed step by step keeping you there waiting for more, needing to know more.. It's all a big puzzle and every time you you feel you have it all figured out you get this big surprise that changes it all.I don't know this for sure, but I guess the first book is my favorite, because it sets the stage for the other 2 books and it has a bit of everything: action, suspense, romance, drama, humor.. The most important characters are presented here, and I don't know if it is just because you get to know them better though the story, but you really care for them and want them to be safe.You start by knowing that there is only one winner in this game, and Katniss is such a lovely girl so you want her to win.. and then you get to know also other people (like Rue and Peeta) and you just want them too so badly to find a way to survive, and you know that it's not possible and this really breaks your heart.And so, there is Peeta.I loved him in this book (the truth is that I loved him in the others too, but at the end of the first book I felt the most hopeful about him and Katniss, about their love). I would've probably loved to read something from his point of view, mostly I would've loved to read about the moments when he decided to stay with the Careers to keep Katniss safe (and this is funny because mostly he is the one saved by the other - even by Katniss), i wanted to know more about his reasons, how he managed it, how he really felt.. Because all we know about him is through the other characters and is not enough for me.But as litlle as I knew about him I couldn't make myself not loving him. From the moment I read the ""bread story"", from the moment he declared he loved Katniss, from the way he always tried to protect her, from the way he invited her to kiss him.. from the way he was so hurt by the fact that she didn't love him and only pretended to, but he was still there prepared to give his life for her.. Everything about him was so sweet in this messy world they were part of. Reading about him felt like a summer breeze in all the drama.All in one: this is such a wonderful book. I would recommend it to the entire world, it touched my heart and I know that I will keep it in my mind for a long long time.

This is Survivor meets Battle Royale. And I wish Nietzsche was alive to read this, because this is the kind of thing he talks about in On the Genealogy of Morals. But I'll save my philosophical rantings for another day.I love the idea of the Hunger Games, and I even think humans are just crazy enough to come up with this idea. My only problem with this book is that it didn't give enough of a detailed background for me to understand how their government system got put into place, which is always important in dystopian novels. Also, everything leading up to them being in the arena was so slow moving that I was hoping for one of Katniss's arrows to strike me in the head. But once they entered the arena, I couldn't put the book down.Katniss has easily become one of my favorite characters of all time, and Peeta is at the top of my shit list right now. You're in the middle of a kill or be killed competition and your only concern is whether or not some girl loves you back? Please stop. I think Katniss is exactly the kind of character I needed to read about. She may come off as cruel or harsh towards Peeta and some of the others, but is there a more caring person in this book? The way she tends to her family and even little Rue shows her true nature. Suzanne Collins did an excellent job with with her characterization, but I wish she didn't make Peeta come off as only caring about Katniss. I don't think it came off the way she wanted it to. If he was intended to be the pure hearted character like Samwise, she missed the mark.For me, this operates great as a stand alone novel, and I'm not sure if I will venture into the other two just yet. I enjoyed the concept, and the emotions in it were very real. I wish the book was from a third person perspective, looking in on each contestant's time in the arena. It would have been longer I'm sure, but much cooler to see what went on when Katniss was unconscious. If you enjoy dystopian novels, you will enjoy this. It's realistic, and it's fun, in a sick and twisted way.","Sep 16, 2017"

I loved it, but I don’t know if that’s enough. I love lots of crap and I hate lots of –what’s the antonym of crap?—classics?—whatever, you get it…… and the 4 star rating might just make people think that this sucks because you know, I suck… What to do… what to do.A good YA story usually has one (or more) of these formulas:A. Teen has some sort of family tragedy/loss of parent to: major illness/car accident/murder/desertion/etc. You can expand with loss of sibling, pet, BFF, you know…B. Teen has to overcome some sort of horrific experience (usually having to do with A.) It could also be rape/incest (see C.)C. Teen has to deal with peer pressure; this could be sex, gang-related sex, girl on girl/boy on boy sex, bad sex (usually not good sex), D. Teen has self-esteem issues and usually has to go through some sort of awakening to realize their full potential. This usually is some sort of journey of self discovery.E. Vampires Now, I’ve always had a special place for the YA novel. From Ponyboy’s English assignment to Margaret’s quest for the ultimate bosom to Bella’s neurosis over her vampire lover. I am there; I’m along for the ride, baby. The Hunger Games is no exception to this rule. I was sucked in from Chapter Two. Can I really explain why? Probably not. It has most of the above formulas (okay, we’re veering away from vampires and sex, sort of) but the way that Suzanne Collins (sidenote: I hesitated on picking this up thinking it was Jackie Collins… you know, of Hollywood Wives fame? I wonder if I’m alone on that.) puts her protagonist, Katniss, through these ‘formulaic’ events is so subtle/not subtle that you can forgive the basics. I’ve also heard that this book isn’t all that original. That Battle Royale and The Game have similar premises. This may be so… I wasn’t all that surprised about the whole ‘Race/fight for your Life’ tournament concept even though I haven’t read or seen the above mentioned plots. So, again, I’m having trouble explaining why I loved this book.  I just did. Does that work? I’m sorry. It’s all I have at the moment. That and 'Screw you! It was awesome!' I’m hoping that I can get the second installment from the library soon. I’m excited to find out what happens with Katniss and Peetra and Gale. Sometimes I think I’ve never really grown up and, sadly, I’m okay with that.","Nov 25, 2009"

They're soooo depressing and they seem to rarely end well. Soylent Green is made of people! I even hated The Giver. Yeah, that's right. I said it. I know, everyone looooves that book. Except me...and probably every kid in eighth grade who had to write a report on it. So there. Nayh. Anyway, my point is that I can't stand to read depressing stories about some bleak future looming on the horizon. I did not want to read Hunger Games. However, I have a goodreads friend, who shall remain nameless (cough) DORSI (cough), who has been basically pestering me for close to a year now to read this thing. She drove me nuts with it. Every comment she left me ended with a variation on the phrase, 'Have you read Hunger Games yet?'. Honestly, I considered de-friending her, but I was afraid she'd just hunt me down and show up at my door with a copy of this book in her hand. Ok, I'm kidding. Sort of.At any rate, I thought after a while she would give up on me as a lost cause, but noooooo. Like a rabid dog with a bone, she just wouldn't let it go. A few weeks ago, she finally snared me in her net. ""So, it's been a while. Have you had a chance to read Hunger Games?"". Gah! This time I had no defense. I was running low on new ideas for reading material, and in my paranoid state of mind...I was sure she knew it! She had me cornered. I could see that the year I spent skillfully tap dancing around her requests had all been for nothing. There was no escape. I felt the cold chill of defeat sink into my bones.So I read the book.(Pretty anticlimactic, huh? Yeah. I thought so, too.)Now comes the hard part. I have to apologize to my nameless friend.Ahem. (deep breath in...deep breath out)Dorsi...er, Nameless Friend, you were right and I was wrong. Hunger Games is a really good book. You are not a crazy person, and I am glad you shoved this book down my throat. The fact that I hate the entire genre and still ended up giving it 4 stars means that you have excellent taste.

The amount of terrible writing fit into those ten pages is absolutely phenomenal. It could have been written by a ten-year-old. It seemed that every sentence began with an ""and."" ""And my dad died. And it was really sad. And I was a little girl. And my mommy must have loved my daddy very much."" There was no emotion, no character development, and no surprises. I seriously felt that this was the worst book I had ever read. Period.Fortunately, I was reading this at the beach, and therefore was able to shut off the part of my brain that could ACTUALLY THINK. Once I did that, it was smooth sailing. If I were thinking, this book probably would have insulted my intelligence.However, I am still puzzled by the fact that everyone seems to like these books. This book felt so generic, I felt like I was at a pharmacy (and that analogy is probably better than any you will read in this book).What did everyone like so much about this book? The good writing? Nope. The good character development? Nope. The predictable plot lines? Nope. WHY DOES EVERYONE LIKE THIS BOOK?","Jul 06, 2011"

  Best apocalyptic YA teen novel I've read this year.
Fair warning, there's a love triangle, but I can handle it (and I can't stomach too many of those) . It's Mostly because Katniss does not feel for either guy and makes that abundantly apparent (until she has to fake a bit for the cameras). I appreciate that the smidge of romance does not overpower the novel. This plot doesn't solely hang on which boyfriend she chooses - it's more of a survive-and-maybe-you'll-see-your-family-again.Her pride and will to survive energized the novel. Katniss's love for her sister humanized the otherwise stiff character and kept me completely hooked.","Nov 07, 2017"

It prompted me to create an entirely new bookshelf. I dreamed I was in the arena watching the other tributes, and it was quite intense.I really enjoyed the first part of the book. Katniss’ self-preservation in the beginning really levelled out once she claimed her sister’s place in the Games. Katniss quickly became very admirable for me, even though I don’t approve of everything she did. I especially enjoyed the part in the novel where Katniss is treated like a princess. It was okay for this little fantasy to play out, because we all knew she’d be fighting for her life in a short time. Most times when heroines are spoiled like this, they don’t earn it, or want it, but they do love it. Katniss didn’t like it, didn’t want it, but was going to earn it regardless of whether or not she won the Games. (view spoiler)[And all the over-eating was actually essential to the plot later on, which I thought was totally awesome. (hide spoiler)]While I feel Katniss deserves her place on my shelf of kick-ass heroines, it’s not because of what she does in the Games. It’s because she can take care of herself outside of the Games. (view spoiler)[Inside the Games I felt that Katniss was way too much of a goody-goody. She killed four people, but it only feels like she killed one, and it’s framed in such a way that you’re supposed to cheer for that guy’s death because he brutally murdered Katniss’ child ally. The three other people, the two girls who died from wasp stings and the boy at the end mauled by the mutts were entirely her responsibility as well, but because the wasps were a case of you-didn’t-move-fast-enough and Cato’s death was out of pity, I guess it mostly gets glossed over. (hide spoiler)]I also felt that the reports that the violence in this book was beyond horrible were grossly exaggerated. But hey, I grew up on Animorphs. (view spoiler)[The deaths of the other tributes were often glossed over and mostly happened off-screen. I almost shed a tear when Rue and Foxface died, and my favourite scene is probably when Thresh killed Clove, but all up I feel the Games just weren’t that violent to the reading audience. Katniss’ tactic was to avoid the other tributes and let them kill themselves, and it was a great tactic. Not so great for an audience. (hide spoiler)] In fact I spent a lot of the time feeling like this was a survivalist novel, and worldbuilding what was safe to eat and how to hunt it, not a gladiator-style fight to the death.I felt that sometimes there was way too much contrivances on behalf of the plot. I almost felt like Collins was being a bit of a helicopter author. Yes, Katniss went through some horrible stuff, because she’s fighting for her life… but she always got what she needed in the end. (view spoiler)[I can accept the healing balm gift for her burns as essential to plot because she’d barely be able to move without it, but the sleeping draught for Peeta just stank of contrivance. There were other options she could have taken and maybe things wouldn’t have worked out so great. (hide spoiler)] It seemed to me that more than once, when given the chance to create conflict, the opportunity was missed.I labelled this book a romance but it’s not really. It’s not about her relationship with Peeta. It has romantic elements but basically I didn’t feel that Katniss felt anything other than affection for Peeta because they were from the same District. Certainly she’s not in love with him at this point but she does need his support from their shared experiences. I won’t deny that they have a bond, but Katniss spends the majority of the book completely ignorant of his feelings, or convinced he’s doing it just for the show.Speaking of show, I was very confused about the concept of the cameras filminf the Games. Katniss kept mentioning how she’d look to the audience and how her face should be visible and stuff like that, and I never once saw a camera or any evidence she was being filmed at all. She was even convinced she was being filmed in a cave. In a cave! There was no camera crew running around the arena, there were no hoverdrones filming anyone, no cameras stuck in trees or clothing a la The Truman Show. It frustrated me because as far as I was aware, from the information Katniss was feeding me, there was absolutely no evidence she was being filmed. Yet she was constantly aware of being filmed… and there was nothing there. Ever.For a long time I was very excited that Katniss was one of those rare heroines who, once she got into a fight, kept her wounds and scars and didn’t come out perfect and preened and primped and gorgeous-looking, like they haven’t just been in a brawl to the death. I didn’t get the feeling that Collins was deliberately trying to make or keep Katniss beautiful, (view spoiler)[especially faced with starvation, burns, wasp stings, dehydration and covered in blood,  (hide spoiler)] and I liked that. That’s why I’m a little torn about what I feel at the end. (view spoiler)[While I agree that Katniss earned her right to be beautiful, I disagree with her losing all her scars, especially the ones she earned pre-Games. (hide spoiler)]What I liked about Katniss was that she was intelligent and capable, and although she often felt despairing, she never gave up. Also, I like Effie quite a lot – her job must be absolutely horrible – but Cinna was my favourite secondary character, after Rue and Foxface.So in conclusion, although there were several things I disliked about this book, or that frustrated me (such as a lack of polish around dialogue construction), I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I very much would like to add the hardcover trilogy to my collection so that I can read the other two books.","Mar 13, 2011"
"9780439023481","2551271","Dominic","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2551271-dominic","In one sense, Suzanne Collins crafts a fast-paced, whirlwind guilty pleasure; on the other, it is only a nice attempt at creating something memorable that misses the mark.It really felt like Collins was trying to write something that would have the longevity and incredible following of Harry Potter series. The odd characters, their unique names like Cinna and Katniss and Prim (not to mention the muttations and the tracker jackers), just all scream Harry Potter to me. Even the villain’s name Cato looks a lot like Draco, don’t you think? Collins, though, just cannot make us become entranced with her world like J.K. Rowling does with hers. I am not especially intrigued, or even better really repulsed, by Panem, while I have imagined myself at Hogwarts—and I’m over 30 years old! While both books have to provide lots of backstory so we can understand the contexts of their world, only one gets it right. Rowling’s use of an outsider character is a brilliant device of narration; as Harry learns about Hogwarts and magic, so do we. The narration of Katniss, on the other hand, plods for me and at times seems unbelievable. Her observations and questions were often exaggerated, while Collins’ characterization seemed simplistic. Haymitch, for example, could have had much more depth than he did—his drinking could have been connected more to his damaged psyche having to live on after experiencing the horror that is the Hunger Games. In addition, those kids who actually survive the Games don’t seem especially traumatized. Yet, when Rowling's characters survive, they still feel like real kids facing a real adolescence along with trying to save the world. You believe it.I also think Rowling can write a better sentence than Collins. The descriptions of the extravagant food and fire-bearing clothing seemed like an attempt to just “color up” the world and make it memorable instead of providing real depth to the story; I was even bored at the long build up to the actual games. I was also bothered by the “new rule” added on page 244, and even more so by the concept of the sponsors, which seemed unfair and kind of lame. The love interest thread of the story was unnecessary, too, don’t you think? I mean, I thought Katniss was so badass throughout the whole story, and I hated that the author felt this strong 15 year old female character needed a love interest.It’s a bit unfair that the book I had just finished before starting Hunger Games was The Book Thief, by Marcus Zusak. If you haven’t read this YA novel, you should. It is poetic and heartbreaking and scary and epic—I hope I can get a few young folks to read The Book Thief when I know many will read The Hunger Games instead. Where HG is light and action-packed, BT is painfully realistic and heavy. In one sense there is no comparison. (Zusak’s book tells the story of a German orphan who befriends a Jew who is hiding in her foster home, where she learns both the awesome and terrible power of words.) But yet, when I picked up Collins’ book and read the outer flap, it says about the author, “she continues to explore the effects of war and violence on those coming of age.” I was first intrigued—but Oh, the overstatement! The Hunger Games could have really said something the way Shirley Jackson’s “The Lottery” says something or like “The Most Dangerous Game” says something. The Hunger Games could have come close to The Book Thief, but it is no way in the same league. A missed opportunity, I think.There are also obvious references our culture’s obsession to the reality show here. In a way, Panem’s ritual viewing of this despicable bloodbath surely is satire of our own low-brow viewing each week. The networks keep churning out the dreck, and we keep tuning in. While most reality shows out there are practically unwatchable, I find one of the first, Survivor, to have some real-life implications and some real parallels to Hunger Games. Sure, each season there are another 16 media whores trying to be the last one on the island and win a million dollars. But what we get to witness is a sometimes probing (but I’ll admit, ultimately shallow) look into human nature.Hunger Games could have been as clever or as well-crafted as Harry Potter or as powerful or as chilling as The Book Thief. But it ends up being only a YA book version of Survivor—a (sometimes probing, but ultimately shallow) guilty pleasure of a show I enjoy watching when it comes on but I know deep down I’d rather be watching Mad Men. But kudos for Collins for knowing which is going to sell more books. Millions more people tune into Survivor than either of these much more thoughtful fare. Just as millions more, I’m sure, will read Hunger Games before they try The Book Thief.","Jul 22, 2009"

I noticed all the teens reading it in the doctor's office I worked at and just thought it must be a good book for their age. I finally asked one of my patients how the book was and I remember her gushing like I use to when the new issue of Teen Bop magazine hit the stands. All she said was something like ""I love it. It's so good."" I thought it was about a video game...Then the other books came out. Then the very first movie. Then Netflix got the rights to air it. I was bored one night, probably out of library books to read, so I saw it and decided to watch it. Really good movie. Not about a video game, in the least. I started seeing the shirts, towels, posters, costumes, music cd's and even notebook folders decorated with The Hunger Games stuff. Fast forward to two weeks ago... Catching Fire came out on Netflix. I watched it. Another excellent movie in the (now I knew it was a trilogy) series. Then a book friend of mine on this site told me she was reading the series, as she had not also read them yet. I liked the movies. Maybe what I will find out, what I always find out all the time when I read a book after the movie. That the book is so much BETTER than the movie, even if the movie was great. ALWAYS!!I look in my library. Nope, checked out. I'm put on a list of other teens/adults. Then today I got an email that my Amazon Unlimited subscription was going to bill my card again. It had been a few weeks since I looked at what they had. The Hunger Games was listed, the whole series was listed. SCORE!! I sync the series to my Kindle app on my tablet and off to reading I go. OMG... talk about mixed emotions. I cried, laughed, felt sorrow, rage and happiness! This book was an absolute roller coaster to read. One of those ones that goes real fast and scares the piss out of you fun roller coasters.What did Maouijenn learn...1. If you see a ton of teenagers/tweens reading the same book. READ IT!2. Buy it. Don't wait till it's your turn on the list to read it at your library.3. Read it again, know it front to back before the movie comes out.4. Gush about it with the teenagers/adults.5. Listen to the teenagers. They know good books. How does Mauoijenn feel...1.

"9780439023481","1257768","Sarah (Presto agitato)","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1257768-sarah-presto-agitato","Dystopian stories are disturbing in proportion to their plausibility. At first, The Hunger Games doesn’t seem particularly feasible, with an elaborate annual event that requires each of twelve districts in Panem (formerly North America) to offer up a boy and a girl as tributes for a match to the death in which only one will survive. The explanation given for this brutal practice is that it is the Capitol’s (not Capital’s) way of punishing and terrorizing the districts for rebelling seventy-four years ago. Far-fetched as that may seem, the idea of child sacrifice to propitiate angry gods is hardly a new one, and, horrifyingly, still occurs. And of course the ancient Romans enjoyed watching gladiatorial combat for entertainment, a reference Suzanne Collins drives home by giving many of the Capitol’s citizens Roman names. The modern twist here, though, is that the Hunger Games are a national reality TV event for the citizens of Panem. The subjects in the oppressed districts are forced to watch. The lucky citizens in the Capital, exempt from offering their children in sacrifice, enjoy the entertainment, and the bloodier the better. The Hunger Games are sort of Survivor meets Amazing Race meets Big Brother.Speaking of Big Brother, I couldn’t help but be reminded of the first season of the American version of the reality television show. During that season, the contestants were mostly fairly likeable, unwilling to engage in cutthroat antics like their more scheming counterparts on Survivor. America didn’t help much by repeatedly voting out anyone controversial or ambitious. By the end of the season, viewers were treated to scintillating scenes of the cast amiably putting together a jigsaw puzzle together. While that might speak well for humanity, it was a disaster for ratings. When the show miraculously came back for a second season, it had been completely revamped, with a far more competitive cast and nastier scenarios. Soon contestants were secretly cleaning toilets with each other’s toothbrushes, and ratings soared. The show is now in its 14th season.Would people really want to watch something as horrible as the Hunger Games? It seems ludicrous, yet round-the-clock Misery Channel coverage of events like Princess Diana’s death and the OJ Simpson trial seemed to initiate an era where we lap up disasters with an almost gleeful enthusiasm. Reality TV followed, with the nastiest, most scheming contestants bringing in the highest ratings. Perhaps it’s best not to think too hard about how such entertainment would be received.","Jun 22, 2012"

The Hunger Games is probably one of the strangest specimen I've ever come across. Okay, first we have Katniss. I was skeptical, but she actually is a strong female character. She doesn't take shit, she makes her own decisions, she's intelligent...and I like her. I like to read about her. I admire her for standing up for her sister -- sure, it seems like a plot device but it wasn't written in a way that came off like that. The world building was a little annoying, because it was inconsistent and didn't make much sense. Why would the districts be afraid of the Capitol? The districts import from the Capitol, so the Capitol can't do a repeat of District 13 without depriving themselves of something or the other. If all of the districts went on a strike, it'd be the Capitol saying ""Ut oh"". One line in the entire book stuck out to me,To this day, I can never shake the connection between thisboy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and thedandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed.The dandelion that reminded her she was not doomed? The bread that gave her hope? Oh come on, not even I am that much of a SAP.But other than that? The prose was consistent. I've heard more than once that Suzanne Collins rewrote The Hunger Games from third person to first, and for that she has a lot of my respect. But for other things...Such as...the love triangle...WHY? WHY DID YOU DO THIS? We didn't need any romance in the book! At first Peeta's crush on her was cute, and I was like ""D'awww!"" but then it got annoying. Especially when they began to force them together? That was just sick. Of course she's pissed at first, but then everybody keeps reminding her ""Oh! It's just for the games! It's just for the games! You want to live, don't you?""ARGH!You want to know the truth about the pairings I support?! You really want to know?THE HELL WITH KATNISS PEETA/GALE!RUE AND THRESH!Yes, yes, I went there. Who cares?

Speaking of food and all… Will I burn in hell for thinking that all this starvation did well to the ever obese American children?Oh well… back to more serious matters…I liked Katniss’ attitude, her inner strength, the way she thinks, and the fact that she’s a realist. She has good logic and intelligence and isn’t even near the annoying level YA heroines usually reach. She is admirable and worthy of being a role model.Quick question. Where are the cameras? I imagine something similar to Spiderman Shattered Dimensions. There was a level where Deadpool trapped Spiderman on a platform in the middle of the ocean and forced him to save the crew while cameras filmed his every move. The cameras used to have propellers and were always buzzing around being annoying just like mosquitos. I doubt they’re done this way in the book but that doesn’t stop me from imagining them this way. And Deadpool being the host... The perfect show! Oprah would self-combust because of jealousy!The conclusion? A-f*ckin-mazing! Loved every second of it!

  “Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be ever in your favor.”
Now that's a line, every one of us will forever remember. I love this book. I love dystopias, they are my personal brand of heroine. I don't know what I'd do without them. Most dystopias have that something real that some fantasy books lack and I think that's because of the drama being to much for you to notice the fact that it's all made up like every other book. Suzanne Collins has one hell of a mind and I can't begin to comprehend how she came up with such a complex storyline. She created a very badass heroine who's needed in every good book, and a guy who's like gold, literally. Twelve districts, twenty-four tributes. Katniss Everdeen & Peeta Mellark of District 12. Katniss did the unthinkable, something not done in quite a while. She volunteered as tribute when her sister's name was called up. Is there anything more selfless than the act of sacrifice in the face of tragedy? I think not.Most find Katniss spiteful and an angry person and Peeta too sweet. I just think that Katniss is a girl who's been through hell, especially after this book and if you say that Peeta has been through just as much I'll tell you that no every person has the same strength and personality. Every person is made of different material, for better or for worse.I like the way Katniss and Peeta's relationship evolves throughout the book. We see how Katniss begins to care for that stupid and careless but amazing boy and even though their romance is just a pretense she finds herself really caring for him. That was beautiful.Thanks for reading this!","Sep 04, 2013"

Oh, how wrong I was! Because I was just as much an emotional roller coaster reading this as I was the very first time I read it. There is just something about this story. Something about Katniss and the lengths she will go to protect herself (and later Peeta) that just not only pulls on your heartstrings and makes you really feel, but it makes you think rather hard too. About things like freedom and oppression. About when it is time to say that enough is enough. This is a fantastic book that I think is important for everyone to read at least once.First reading:I picked this book up by chance a little over a year ago while I was browsing for something new to read. Right from the first chapter I was hooked. This is a story about survival, about growing up and finding yourself; dicovering who you really are by how you act in certain situations. The characters are amazing and the story and plotlines are just incredible. When Katniss is in the dome, struggling to survive; you feel as if you are with her every step of the way. You will come away from this book feeling as if you know the characters personally, you really care about them. I absolutely cannot praise this book enough for being so amazing.

However, I appreciate that they are geared to a specific audience and they get that audience to read (and I did my time with Sweet Valley High and The Babysitter's Club *cringe* in junior high and turned out just fine--sort of). Typically, however, there's just too much teen angst, star crossed lovers, and sparkly men for my taste. Now, having said that, The Hunger Games was a great novel. Two teenagers are chosen from the twelve districts that make up Panem (what was once the U.S.) to participate in the Hunger Games, a fight to the death televised on national television as a reminder of who is really in control of this impoverished dystopian future. Suzanne Collins doesn't pull any punches--there is violence and there are several deaths in the arena, but they are portrayed with just the right touch (not too graphic, but also not too watered down). There are some nice plot twists (another complaint I often have with young adult--they're usually predictable to more sophisticated readers) and finally, finally, finally a strong female character who can take care of herself inside and outside of the arena.

That's like a YA Classic, what is wrong with you?  And its crazy because I haven't read this series for so long. And I owned the books for about 4 years. So i don't really deserve to have an excuse. But since there is a lot of confusion, I will tell you why I haven't read this series in so long.Year #1  One of my reasons as to why I haven't read this book yet is because the year I bought this book was the year it got severely damaged. Since I got the paperback edition, it was so easy to ruin it and crumple it. I wanted to read the book in class and took it to school on the worst possible day. It was raining and when I opened my bag, my book was soaked. I was so upset and I tried to open the book but it was so wet, the pages were ripping. So to avoid damaging it even more, I avoiding the book.Year #2  After that horrific experience, I didn't take this book to school on a rainy day. The next year, I took my book to class on the sunniest day possible. But I had a friend who thought it was funny to throw all of my things on the floor. My things as in all of my binders, my pencil case, and most importantly, my book. It was so annoying, I told her to stop and she did eventually but it was already too late. My book was so damaged that I left it at home and promised to read it when I got free time at home. I wasn't planning on reading my book at school anymore.  A few weeks later in the year, we heard about the Hunger Games movie which was going to release. Our teachers decided that it would be a great idea to take the students on a trip to watch the movie. I was so excited but I realized that I haven't read the book yet. I only had a week before we went to the trip and I was a super slow reader when I was younger. So I decided that I would read the book as fast as possible. In the end, I only managed to finish three chapters... After watching the movie, I had almost all of the first book spoiled. It was my fault of course, I didn't HAVE to go to the movies but I wanted to. I could have read faster, but I didn't. And I could have read it before this ever happened but I didn't. So it was my fault. (Til this day, I have a bookmark on Chapter 3 of the Hunger Games and I can't believe it's still in there!)Year #3  A year passed and I was getting ready to say goodbye to all of my old friends. We were all moving on to different high schools. I had it rough for the whole year, feeling sad and left out. I read books as much as I could but I never picked up the Hunger Games. I let the whole trilogy sit on my bookshelf, catching dust. I felt so out of place this year because I didn't know what I wanted for my future. (Still don't by the way!) And I had so many other book recommendations that I decided to read these books instead.  My school decided to go and watch Catching Fire and I didn't even try to finish the Hunger Games and Catching Fire. I was spoiled on almost everything of the first two books. By the time the year was over, I hadn't even thought about reading the Hunger Games.Year #4  My first year in high school, it was hard to find friends. I tried talking to people but most of them already knew each other. Everyone ignored me and I was super lonely. Luckily I had one friend, but we were lonely together. Even though we had each other, I had this hollow feeling in my stomach. I felt so sad, it's so hard to express how I felt. I never thought about books that much, sure I read a lot but I forgot all about the Hunger Games. It just continued to sit on my book shelf. Present  My second year of high school is where I lost my lonely, depressing feeling. I decided to talk more to others and be careful with who I choose to be friends with. My friend and I made so many other friends that I finally felt a little more included. I had so much fun and the is more fun that awaits me in the future. I have friends who I can talk about books with. I have friends who I can talk about anime with. I have friends who just want to talk about life. And all of these friends give me the happiness and recognition that I have never had before.  I talked to a bunch of my book buddies and I realized that I still haven't read the Hunger Games yet. I decided that it was finally time to pick up this book, instead of letting it sit on my shelf. It felt so good to finish the book and I am so annoyed with myself for not picking this up sooner. I missed out on so much and I have been spoiled on the whole series. But it doesn't matter because I have read the first book in this trilogy!And Now for the review!  I am pretty sure all of you know about the Hunger Games. But for those of you who don't know what this is about, it is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen who lives in District 12. Every year, two teenagers of the age 12 to 18 are chosen to participate in the annual Hunger Games. One girl and one guy are chosen to join the other districts in a game that is deadly. This is a game where all of the contestants have to fight til death. It is caught on camera and is known as entertainment to the Capitol. To save one that she loves, Katniss has no choice but to volunteer to participate in the Hunger Games. 
  “You don’t forget the face of the person who was your last hope.” 
 This book was so sad to read, there was so much that happened. It was so painfully good, I felt like I was in pain while reading this. I loved everything about it but it was just so sad. The things the characters have to go through and the emotions displayed among the characters was so powerful. It was interesting to read and although I knew everything that was to come, there were a few things that I didn't expect. I wish I read this book earlier, I would have enjoyed it more because I wouldn't have been spoiled.
  “Remember, we're madly in love, so it's all right to kiss me anytime you feel like it.” 
 The characters were great, I loved everything about Katniss. She was so powerful and epic, her character was just so strong. Her bow skills are amazing, and I enjoy reading about her. Peeta is another awesome character. He makes me laugh, even when depressing things are going on. He knows how to make a person laugh. Gale is another awesome character but I wish we got to read more about him. He is so nice and I love how he has Katniss's back. I love when he calls Katniss, Catnip. Prim is such a sweet character but I wish I got to read more of her too. Rue is so sweet I loved her so much. Cinna is an amazing person, I remember I felt the same way in the movies too. Haymitch is hilarious and he may not be amazing but I still like his character.
  “I am not pretty. I am not beautiful. I am as radiant as the sun.”
 The writing was beautiful, it flowed very nicely. I loved the things the characters said, the lines were so powerful. Reading about what the characters have to go through gives me the chills. It was interesting but I was scared to see what would happen next. This book was very bittersweet. 
  “Destroying things is much easier than making them.” 
 I highly recommend this book to anyone who hasn't read it yet. I doubt that there are many people who haven't read this series. I mean, it's a classic. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a crazy book filled with adventure, and something that hits you hard in the feels. A book filled with the strongest characters that go through so much.

"9780439023481","647547","Mariel","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel","Goodreads doesn't need another review of The Hunger Games, probably, but I'm going to do it anyway. I read The Hunger Games a couple of months after it first came out, I think. I liked it, thought it had potential to be something more special than it was. I thought the fast pace was too fast to carve out all of the terroritories it could. Cut off the water supply and starve me out. Catching Fire came out, and then Mockingjay. Mockingjay got to me. Okay, so is is my case to read the rest of the series beyond The Hunger Games. It is worth it to read the whole story. They aren't perfect books but Suzanne Collins had something that she wanted to say and I think she did it. I used to read a fair amount of ya. I don't read it anymore. The last ya series I read was Patrick Ness's Chaos Walking. I loved the first one, liked the second one and loathed the final book. Something (and a whole lot more besides) about the supposed egoism of younger readers and heroics. I would have hated it when I was young too. I am hesitant to write off all of ya as easy route because of the assumed intelligence of the readership. But if author interactions on goodreads is any indication (the cat fights when adults call them out on their shit, for one), some authors count on the kids not giving a crap. They sell and when something sells it attracts the people who don't give a crap. Maybe they are just stories that I can't relate to anymore (there are exceptions. Melina Marchetta wrote two books that relate to my life as long as I've lived it). I want the piece in their lives, not some grand gesture that emasculates the whole thing.I liked this so much. Katniss Everdeen doesn't owe anyone else her whole life. She didn't owe it to anyone else to be the bad-ass female who comes in and saves their asses. For all that she is hoped or feared to be the girl on fire, Collins doesn't say that she had to be. My fondness of this series is a lot because of that. If I were a teenaged girl living in a war zone I would try to find a way to get used to it. Katniss had her name in the drawing for the reaping a lot of times (twenty or thirty something? Less than Gale's but not by many). She already had to live on a don't think about the future mode. What else did she have to look forward to? Working in the mines and possibly dying, like her dad. Her sister getting chosen in a reaping. If I were anyone living in the world with an abiding sense of all the shit floating on the surface I would still have to find a way to not fully think about it. If you live in a constant state of fear your heart will give out. She didn't have to be the heroine any more than anyone else from those districts did. I don't blame Katniss for caring about her sister before the rest of the districts. That's a lot for anyone's shoulders. Yeah, I did already know that. I don't leaf through history books and take it for granted the good others did before me. People dead in wars, in jail for protesting, poverty and no fun. If I'm not going to give up reading all day and the other stupid things I think are important why would I expect anyone else to? Everybody gets one life, if they are lucky. Anyway, I thought that was a worth while thing to say. The Hunger Games trilogy is about what the districts and people in history ask of people who have to give up the bits of themselves. Why do they have to look perfect while doing it? She didn't want to die. She wanted any life she could get. Wasn't volunteering for her sister enough? It's a story about one girl. There are lots of other books too and more than enough other people to think about. Collins picked Katniss because she had such a hard time getting what she could. That's gotta be true about a whole lot of other kids in the world who have to try and get what they can while they can. She had other things to say too. But that's what I got the most. Collins's books understood the weight. I would have liked the books more if she was less heavy handed about propaganda as a tool itself. They are written like best sellers, you know. Maybe I shouldn't try to review books I read years ago. But the right to NOT be a hero? Definitely. It resonates when you read all of the books and see how much Katniss loses because people thought she had to be the heroine of the world. I realize I just wrote a lot about the ""message"" of the books. What I liked about the books were the parts when Katniss had that little bit. Her sister, Peeta, singing, her friendship with Gale, hunting, the woods under a wire. All the moments stolen. Future? Stolen. The message in the ashes, under the brush and not blasted on mandatory television sets. I bet the other kids in the games had theirs too. I don't blame any of them for fighting. Peace of mind on the bonfire. Girl and boys on fire. (I think I would have killed myself like those girls in Battle Royale.) They didn't owe anyone else their skin. If they meet in a red room after the games they would not blame each other. The small lives for the bigger? They weren't volunteers. I know I couldn't ask it, anyway. Not for me.I'm no hero.P.s. Sorry if you're sick of The Hunger Games!","Jun 30, 2009"

I seriously should be punished for this.The Hunger Games is one of the best dystopian novels I’ve read until now, maybe the best. It was so well done and interesting and fast paced that I didn’t want to put the book down but keep reading and keep reading.I had watched the movie and I had thought that it was okay but nothing special after all and I couldn’t understand why people were raving and raving about it. Now that I read the book I am the one who’s raving about it and wouldn’t stop talking for days.The world building was impressive and magnificent. Twelve districts and the Capitol, Panem. Every year they draw out a boy and a girl from each district to join the Hunger Games: all the tributes have to train, do interviews and then they are left in an arena to survive and kill each other. There can be only one winner. They are constantly watched by all the population which can follow every day the Hunger Games on special screens put in every district. There’s no privacy and no mercy. You can’t afford to say what you think or show your true feelings but you have to keep up to pretenses to survive in this deadly jungle and try not to lose yourself along the way.The Hunger Games are the tool to show people that they are nothing but pawns in the ends of the system, to remember of the past wars and what the Capitol is able to do just for entertainment. They are the spectacularization of cruelness, violence and strength. The Gamemakers, the sponsors and their gifts, the parade and the mentors, the rules and the history… Everything was so clear and detailed that it seemed more true than ever and while reading you can’t help but having a dreadful feeling that this could all be real one day.Now, on to the characters. Haymitch was just amazing. He’s the mentor of the tributes from District 12, he has gone through unimaginable horrors and won the Hunger Games and now he has to relive this every year. He is always drunk, trying to send the pain away but this time he could actually have winners and he knows what to do to let them shine and capture the attentions of the sponsors. He can also be lots of fun.Katniss was… complicated. She grew up taking care not only of herself but of her entire family after her father died in the coal mine. With her friend Gale, she spends her days hunting in the woods outside the fence, risking her life because it is forbidden but it’s also the only way not to starve. When her twelve-year-old sister Prim is called as tribute, Katniss volunteers to protect her and this was such a strong and full of love gesture. She was courageous, specially knowing she probably wouldn’t have made it back. But she did it anyway and it moved me. She’s smart and unbeatable with bow and arrows and that’s how she plans to survive in the arena. Plus, she’s the girl on fire. Anyway, I didn’t like her as much as I expected to. I was confused by her uncertainty about her feelings. She keeps comparing Peeta and Gale and that sent me astray because there is not much about Gale in this first book and I wasn’t able to pick a side as it usually happens in these love triangle situations. Peeta, on the other hand, was so sweet. He is conscious of his limits and his abilities and in the arena he did whatever he had to do to keep Katniss safe because he truly loved her and that made me roll my eyes every time Katniss wondered about Peeta’s feelings. How couldn’t she see it? He was just being himself while she was pretending to love him back to maintain the star crossed lovers’ illusion. I know she had to do it keep living and make it home to her family but I just couldn’t bring myself to like her.I was really impressed by the author’s ability to keep the story interesting throughout all the book. For more than one hundred pages, the reader is left only with Katniss and her thoughts and it could have easily become boring and flat without any dialogues but it never did.I was also taken aback by the contrast between the poverty of the districts and the uncontrolled luxury of the Capitol, where the Hunger Games truly are just an entertainment while teenagers are losing their lives for others’ fun.Surely, I can’t wait to read the second book, hoping to better understand Katniss and her doubts but also I want more of this dreadful world. Does it sound strange?Happy Hunger Games and may the odds be ever in your favor!","Sep 05, 2013"

I was almost sure that my spontaneous enthusiasm would cover up all the flaws. When you read a book in a day and then read the sequel the next day and then the final book two days later than that, well, you can never be sure. So i thought i should process it first, realize what it had and made me like it so much. First of all, YA is not my kind of gerne. I've been disapointed by several things that i've read and what makes this book stand out of the rest YA that i have read is that, not only i loved reading it, but also that i still love it AFTER reading it.I cannot really judge Katniss. She is 16 and 16 is a stupid age on its own (i am sorry 16 year olds, i have been there, i know, you will understand when you get older). She is not a kid and she is not an adult and she is messed up and no matter how furious some of her choices made me, i will always like her. She made mistakes and she was not perfect and there were so much going on that she couldn't control. She seemed human and i like it when the characters in the book seem real and hurt and damaged when they actually are.I didn't really care about the romance, i believe it would be better if they were just friends. I have issues with the first person narrative in general but i don't mind it being there in the hunger games cz, it serves the book. It is not perfect by any means, but it works just fine and it feels just fine. The world building and the characters we are intoduced to are only through Katniss but even though i wanted more of everything, i liked everything cz not knowing what is going on IS part of the world building of the hunger games.Overall, the writing was kind of childish but it felt ok (i guess i am fangirling now), some likeable characters--> checked, the absolute form of fasicm and evil that rules eveyone and everything--> checked, totally enjoyable while reading it--> checked. Will i read it again in the future? Probably YES <3","Oct 05, 2015"

Did I like the concept of the book? Absolutely not, however, it was well written and despite being distraught, I was also intrigued, and kept on reading. I think because I’m a parent, just the thought of losing a child in any circumstance is inconceivable, but to have them taken from you, knowing that the likelihood of them returning is slim to none, would numb me beyond reason. That’s all I could think about while reading this, was the families of these kids and the “ultimate” televised death show that their children were forced to participate in, and there was nothing they could do to stop it. Needless to say, I was emotionally drained at the end of this book and there are 2 more to read. My therapy bill is going to be enormous. Yet, I find the need to follow this through to the end, morbid curiosity I guess. I really don’t have much more to say, other than if you decide to read this book, be prepared, what happens here is brutal, disturbing, heartbreaking, and draining.

It has attained an iconic status among YA readers (including my son, at whose insistence I read this), while many serious readers have trashed it completely. When I look back on my reading experience, I find that I am caught between these two extreme positions.The Positives:1. A strong female protagonist and her ""weak"" love interest. I liked Katniss (in this book at least: in subsequent ones, her character was seriously weakened, IMO) and I absolutely loved Peeta. I have a soft spot for men who are not macho and strong, but soft and caring.2. The arena of the games. It is a video gamer's paradise, and it was interesting to see the kids devising strategies to survive.The Negatives:1. The story and the world which it takes place in. To me, a society which exists on repression and periodically exhorts its youth to murder one another as a way of coming up in the world simply does not seem credible.2. The narration.

Non posso darmi per vinto senza combattere. Solo continuo ad augurarmi di trovare un modo per... per dimostrare a quelli di Capitol City che non sono una loro proprietà. Che sono più di una semplice pedina.” Se avete la cittadinanza dello stato di Panem e vivete nella parte più povera del Dodicesimo Distretto, il destino non è stato molto benigno con voi. E se poi siete ancora degli adolescenti con l’acne, c’è il rischio che oltre ad andare a scuola vi tocchino delle alzatacce per cacciare nei boschi, piazzare trappole per conigli, fare affari al mercato nero e sfamare la vostra famiglia tutte le sere. Cacciare nei boschi è illegale, si capisce, ma voi dovete pur mangiare. Non si soccombe alla miseria, agli sberleffi del destino, se pure non è stato benigno con voi. Una volta nello stato di Panem c’erano tredici distretti. Adesso sono solo dodici, e il vostro è il più miserevole, il più deriso di tutti. Il Tredicesimo Distretto, qualche sfortunato anno fa, ha deciso che non ci stava più a soddisfare i capricci del governo centrale, ma quelli di Capitol City, centro pulsante del potere, non l’hanno presa troppo bene. Adesso il Tredicesimo Distretto non esiste più e quelli di Capitol City hanno ben pensato di ricordare a tutti gli altri il perché. Ed ecco il motivo per cui ogni anno si tengono gli Hunger Games, cruenta forma di tributo imposta ai cittadini e allo stesso tempo reality show, spettacolo agghindato per far piacere a quelli della capitale. Se siete ancora degli adolescenti con l’acne, sapete che quest’anno agli Hunger Games potreste esserci voi. Può capitare che il vostro nome venga estratto da una boccia di vetro insieme a quello di un compagno, che siate caricati su un treno e spediti come un pacchetto postale verso il mondo civilizzato. Lì vi renderanno presentabili e carini, vi insegneranno come parlare e camminare, vi riempiranno lo stomaco di tutti i cibi che nel distretto non sognavate neppure. E poi, dopo un periodo di addestramento e di vacanza, vi sigilleranno in un’arena insieme ad altri ventitré concorrenti, due per ciascun distretto. E vi lasceranno scannarvi e combattere finché ne rimarrà uno solo. Telecamere piazzate ovunque vi mostreranno a milioni di telespettatori mentre dormite, mangiate, soffrite la fame e la disidratazione, scalate alberi, fuggite dagli incendi, vi uccidete l’un l’altro con molta spettacolarità e violenza. Fuori intanto fioccano le scommesse: più bravi siete, più vi guadagnate sponsor. Meglio riuscite a fingere, più il pubblico vi ama. Ma non c’è tanto tempo per le moine: non vogliamo che una lancia vi trafigga da parte a parte mentre fate un inchino a beneficio dello show. Suzanne Collins costruisce la sua storia con molta intelligenza, trascinando il lettore nel vortice dell’azione senza annoiarlo mai. La parola chiave di questo romanzo è “essenzialità”. Essenziale è lo stile, asciutto fino all’osso, minimale, eppure mai insoddisfacente. I personaggi si definiscono più attraverso le azioni che attraverso i propri pensieri. Le informazioni essenziali sono centellinate qua e là, sulla base della loro funzionalità alla narrazione, e questo conferisce un ritmo veloce, intrigante. E giacché essenzialità non è sinonimo di povertà, il romanzo non manca di commuovere e di turbare e vi trovate con gli occhi lucidi senza capire bene il perché. Le pagine si illuminano di squallore e non possono fare a meno di prendervi alla gola. Essenziale è quello che la Collins mette in ballo. Ritorna alle origini, alla lontana storia dell’uomo o a quella storia che si svolge tutti i giorni, spesso lontano da noi. Tornano in gioco gli istinti basilari, gli istinti ferini che sempre ci muovono: la fame, la sete, la lotta per la sopravvivenza, l’istinto di conservazione, la furia, la vendetta. Valori di tutti i giorni, come l’amore e l’amicizia, vengono messi in discussione, minati da questi bisogni fondamentali e quasi da essi annullati. È difficile essere umani, quando ci viene chiesto di essere animali. È difficile, ma non impossibile, e Katniss, Peeta, Rue sono qui a dimostrarci proprio questo. Tra mille dubbi circa l’autenticità dei propri sentimenti, le proprie reazioni ponderate di fronte alle telecamere, sono qui anche a dirci che, se il destino non è benigno con noi, noi possiamo essere benigni con gli altri. Possiamo anche non fidarci completamente l’uno dell’altro, ma ciò non significa che dobbiamo essere disumani l’uno contro l’altro. Anche se il mondo in cui viviamo pretende bagni di sangue e sospetto e tradimenti, anche se ci vuole come merce commercializzabile, anche se ci vuole silenziosi ed inermi. Se avete la cittadinanza dello stato di Panem e vivete nel Dodicesimo Distretto e siete sopravvissuti agli Hunger Games, è chiaro che silenziosi ed inermi non potrete esserlo mai più. Troppo avete visto, troppo avete sentito e provato in quell’arena fredda come una notte novembrina e torrida come un deserto. Inizierete a porvi delle domande, a camminare con la testa alta, a non permettere che vi trasformino in giocattoli privi di una volontà e di un passato. No, io non credo che sareste disumani mai più. E saprete volgere il vostro furore verso i veri responsabili della vostra condizione. Non il destino, perché il destino non esiste. Ma uomini e donne come voi, che a destino si atteggiano senza averne alcun diritto.","Sep 09, 2011"
"9780439023481","16842102","Mizuki","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16842102-mizuki","First, I want to make it clear that I do think The Hunger Game(HG) is a well written story.But I still think Battle Royale by Koushun Takami is better.Once you had seen impressive things before, you simply won't be so easily thrilled by similar, tamer things.In the fictional universe of The Hunger Games, America had long been ruled by a totalitarian government. Said government divided its subjects into two classes, citizens from the privileged Capital, where people enjoyed wealth and power. The 12 Districts, where most citizens were forced into hard labors and starvation. Since the 12 Districts, along with the destroyed 13th District had once allied together and tired to rebel against the Capital, once the rebellion was suppressed, the Capital brought up The Hunger Games as a punishment for the failed Districts. A game that forced every district to select two teenagers and took them to an isolated Stadium. The selected teenagers were trained and forced to kill one another until there was only one survivor left, while the entire nation watched on.The heroine Katniss was a fatherless girl from the 12th District, when her younger sister was selected for the latest Hunger Game, she replaced her sister and went to the Capital with a boy, Peeta, who was also selected. During the training and preparation for the Game, Katniss formed a friendship with Peeta, who she must eventually kill along with the other teenagers if she wanted to stay alive and go home to her loved ones;and Haymitch, trainer of both Katniss and Peeta, also a former Winner of the Game.The Hunger Games, first book of The Hunger Games series, is cleverly plotted and well written, main characters like Katniss, Peeta and Haymitch are people you can very well related to. The ending is just brilliant. The action is quite good for a YA novel too.What I find lacking in The Hunger Games, probably is a bit of emotional depths and satire.I don't mean to say HG has entirely no emotional depth, for example Katniss' loyalty to her sister and mother, and the friendship/trust between her, Peeta and Haymitch looks pretty realistic. But once the killing started, you can't help feeling like you're watching an episode of a very twisted, deadly and violent Survivor reality TV game show.You just know that Katniss isn't going to die, and somehow she'd find a way to trick or kill her opponents no matter how strong or well trained those opponents might be. BECAUSE WE KNOW SHE'S THE HEROINE AND SHE CAN'T DIE TILL THE VERY END. So frankly it's a bit hard to feel TOO worry about her.As to those opponents mentioned above, they look more like opponents or pawns in a game show than a bunch of real people. We know hardly anything about them, probably saves for the little girl from the 11th District whom Katniss befriended and tried to save. Those other kids from the other Districts hardly had any personality or emotion that we might recognize, so it became difficult to feel anything for them when they died or when Katniss or Peeta was forced to kill them.We never got to feel much of the moral dilemma and guilt Katniss and Peeta had to endure when they were forced to kill other people, because those who died under their hands had basically nothing to do with them (again saves for the little girl from the 11th District). All of the tributes only first saw one another a few weeks before the Game starts after all of them were certain they must kill all of the other people in order to survive. The rule of the Hunger Game makes it crystal clear that they're supposed to be enemies, not friends and buddies.That's when I want to bring up Battle Royale. In my opinion, it's clear that BR had gone into a more hideous, uncomfortable area than HG by making the teenagers who were forced to kill one another classmates. It's a bunch of students who had known each other for at least a few years, who were familiar with one another, someone you see everyday going to school and using the same classroom. Some of them had even became friends and/or lovers. And you got those students battling one another till the last one standing? Then you got some real satire, cruelty, moral dilemma and vivid human drama going on, instead of just an episode of reality game show which the goal is to survive and to 'take care' of those opponents whom no one really cares about.More disturbing still, in BR the movie, they had the students' very own teacher to be the executive of such unimaginable ordeal, the satire on adults' violence became really heart-felt since teachers are supposed to be protectors of their students.Back to HG, despite the well written story, the author offers us little space to explore the social, institutional violence and injustice that had allowed the Hunger Games to be operated for years. Maybe those issues are saved up for the latter books, I'm not sure.My suggestion: It's a good book for teenagers or mature-enough kids; but for adults, it might be just a little too tamed.

Katniss lives in District 12 of a country called Panem, which used to be North America a long time ago. It's a dystopian world, one burdened by oppression and poverty. The capital of Panem is a wealthy place called The Capitol, which rules the remaining twelve districts with an iron hand. Once there were 13 districts, but then there was an uprising and District Thirteen was completely destroyed, and the rebellion crushed. To remind the other districts of their helplessness and subservience, the Capitol holds the annual Hunger Games, a sort of reality show-cum- gladiator ring, where two tributes from each district battle it out to the death until the last man (or woman) standing is declared the victor.Suzanne Collins builds this dystopian society with flawless delicacy. The people are bitter and oppressed, but at the same time, the tone isn't completely dark and depressed. There is an air of resignation, even a sort of acceptance for a way of live that has been the norm for as long as most people remember.The barbarity of the Hunger Games is balanced perfectly against the flightiness of people from the Capitol. There is the barest hint of a moral about oppression and suppression, but it is handled with the lightest of touches. And some of Collins' plot handling is beyond superb. She takes a sixteen year old girl and puts her in a situation where she has to kill twenty three other people in order to stay alive. She makes this girl humane, but not too soft-hearted. She's tough, and pragmatic but she has touches of tenderness. And so, despite the savagery of the entire situation, thanks to her skillful characterization, we fall in love with Katniss.It's not that Katniss doesn't kill in the Hunger Games. It's how she kills, without ever coming off as violent or inhumane, that reveals the true depth of Collins' talent. She kills for vengeance, in self-defence, out of pity. But never, ever does she kill offensively, with the sole aim of advancing herself into the ranks of glory.And Peeta. What can I say about Peeta without coming off as a gooey, big-eyed teenager (which I most definitely AM NOT) with a massive crush? It's not the romantic angle of the Katniss-Peeta relationship that has me so moved. It's just the way he's drawn, an idealist with so much compassion, and a sly sense of humour. For the first time in a long time, I found myself considering a male romantic lead as a person in his own right, instead of merely an accessory of the heroine. I'm not sure how much of a role Gale will be playing in the future books, I scent a triangle ahead, but I hope Suzanne Collins handles that with as much panache as she's handled the rest of the book.This books is definitely one of my top picks for the first millenial decade, and a treat you should not miss, if you haven't indulged already.","Jan 07, 2011"
"9780439023481","22591633","Zanna","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22591633-zanna","As dystopias go, Panem is vividly disturbing. We will observe it from the perspective of Katniss, a resourceful teenager effectively staving off her own starvation and that of her family in deprived and depressed District 12, a coal mining area very distant from the prosperous Capitol. These circumstances vaguely echo the disparity between London and the deprived and persecuted coal mining areas in the North of England. The scrabble to survive is barely leavened, and severely exacerbated by the annual enforced bloodbath and grotesque spectacle of the Hunger Games.Apart from being a little emotionally clueless (I can relate…), Katniss is the sort of kickass female protagonist every YA novel richly deserves, and it’s impossible not to root for her no matter what terrible things she’s forced to do (actually I felt that Collins did a lot to cushion the blow on that front, so I guess I’d feel able to recommend this to older teens). The emotionally smart, love-struck, artistic Peeta is the perfect foil for her (and I enjoyed the against-type gender dynamics throughout).Katniss experiences luxury in the Capitol, but to Collins’ credit, this luxury is not edifying, and the people wallowing in it are either unredeemably awful, completely vacuous, drowning their wits in alcohol, or quietly in revolt. While gender was de-emphasised in the scrabbling-to-survive context of District 12, in the Capitol patriarchal beauty standards suddenly impose themselves and Katniss is “horrible” until she has been stripped of hair from the neck down. The only things cast in a positive light in the Capitol are the food and Katniss’ mysterious, brilliant designer, Cinna, who seems intriguing and potentially rebellious enough to suggest a reappearence in the sequels. The Gamemakers, on the other hand, are repulsively decadent, and completely objectify the “tributes”. Katniss’ depilation is a small aspect of the Gamemaker’s agenda of dehumanisation, which culminates in the arena. Katniss, Peeta, Rue, and even Thresh, by resisting in their limited capacities the Gamemakers’ attempt to turn them into murderous (literal) tributes, an atrocity exhibition, undermine the state’s power to terrorise the population into submission. This is a story about commodified violence as a weapon of domination in which flowers (and compassion) as well as arrows are weapons of resistance. And, in clever ways, love wins again and again and again…","Jan 20, 2017"
"9780439023481","7597268","Carla","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7597268-carla","I honestly fail to see why so many people think this is a good book. From what I understand, this is Collins' first attempt (note the word ""attempt"") at a novel and it clearly shows. The idea itself is a cliche, and the only way to make a cliche work is to breathe new life into it. Unfortunately, Collins' plot is as unoriginal and contrived as the concept. Additionally, her characterizations are completely inconsistent. None of the characters (with perhaps, the exception of Peeta) had a solid or consistent personality. Katniss, especially, was like a blank, empty slate. She was as flat as a paper drawing.Additionally, Collins' writing style leaves much to be desired. Her vocabulary was elementary and her sentence structures were entirely unexciting. And from what I could see, absolutely no one copy edited the manuscript. If someone had, the myriad obvious mistakes would have been caught — mistakes that included: starting sentences with a figure instead of spelling out the number; mixing tenses; and screwing up the difference between ""nauseous"" and ""nauseated.""Maybe I'm crazy. But making it to the end of this ""book"" was like pulling out teeth: nothing short of agonizing.","Feb 02, 2012"

To view the original one, click HERE)5/5 STARS!!It took me a long time to start this book because of my long TBR pile. It stayed for a year on my bookshelf unopened. I just realized that I want to read it after I watched Mockingjay Pt 1.I found the book to be well written with a fantastic pacing. Their is violence in there, but not so over the top as to be distracting.This story was truly life changing. The premise of the story alone is enough for anyone to realize this will not be your run of the mill young adult novel.Overall, The Hunger Games is a fascinating read, even if the concept of a corrupt government abusing it's control over its citizens has been done in similar ways before, this book is certainly the most detailed and memorable one of the lot.","Jan 17, 2015"

"9780439023481","5769334","Aria the Blue Fairy","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5769334-aria-the-blue-fairy","OMGosh! :)Just watched the movie!I know a lot of you have already watched it but heck I was still excited!BEST MOVIE ADAPTATION OF A BOOK EVER.Felt that it was as close as the movie is going to get to the book!Well. :)So excited for the next movie.Will have to read Catching Fire soon.-------------------Dystopian books?Not really my thing.Wither was the first dystopian novel I've read and it seriously gave me a headache.It wasn’t because that book was poorly written but because I was just not comfortable with the fact that young girls were getting kidnapped and sold to rich boys in order to procreate.I have no issues with teen pregnancy but then the kidnapping part and them being sold was a lot like prostitution to me.There were a couple of instances where I swore I was going to put Wither down but I didn’t because I thought it would get better.It didn’t.After that I stirred away from dystopian books until Hunger Games.Hunger Games was another dystopian novel.This book has been on my to-read pile for so long that I almost forgot about it.Sure there were good reviews about it but since it was dystopian, I had to skip it.Then I saw the movie trailer.I thought the trailer was cool but still I didn’t pick the book up.I was still hesitant about the whole dystopian thing.I was afraid that it would turn out just like the other book I read.March 2012 was nearing.The movie was going to be in the big screen soon and that's when I told myself that I had to read it now!So I picked up my copy and began reading it after I got home from work.Chapter 1.OMG!Chapter 2.OMG! OMG!Chapter 3.OMG! OMG! OMG!Then I finished it!I would like to give this book a round of applause! A standing ovation if it's even possible.HUNGER GAMES was AWESOME!One of the best books I have read so far.It had all the elements that make a book fascinating.Despite it being a dystopian novel, I still love it.Completely loved and adored it.The setting of the Hunger Games was in a place called Panem.WHERE IS PANEM?Panem is a future nation that came from the ruins of what we all know as North America.It had twelve districts that were governed by the Capitol.Because of an upheaval that happened before against the Capitol, the Hunger Games was born.The Hunger Games would require tributes –- a boy and a girl whose ages were between 12 and 18 – and they will be chosen to represent their district on the Hunger Games.WHAT HAPPENS DURING THE HUNGER GAMES?The 24 tributes from the different districts had to face each other in the arena.They had to fight for survival.They had to outwit each other.They had to think before they act.They had to show everybody that they are the best.Why?Because only one of them will come out of the Arena.ALIVE.WHAT’S THE STORY ABOUT?The main protagonist is Katniss Everdeen who I loved almost instantly.She was a perfect example of a girl strengthened by poverty.She lived in District 12, which I think was poorest of all the districts.The time to choose the tributes came.Prim, her younger sister was chosen.Katniss loved her sister and volunteered herself in exchange for her sister.Katniss was now District 12’s tribute along with Peeta Mellark who was not really a stranger to her.The chosen tributes were then transported to the Capitol for the Hunger Games.They were prepped and introduce to everyone.Bets were on.People had their own bets to cheer on.Katniss was struggling.Katniss was scared but she couldnt let it show.She had to be strong.Who will she trust?What will she do to survive?How will she prevent herself from getting killed?The Games will change you.REACTION AFTER FINISHING IT:Flabbergasted. I think that is one word that would describe how I felt about the Hunger Games.It was full of action, suspense, drama, romance.What more could you ask for?Katniss was the perfect heroine.She is my type of lead female character.She had this courage in her that lights up like fire.Katniss, the Girl on Fire.I adore her.She wasn’t weak like most of the lead characters in YA books.She was strong, brave and courageous.She was also smart.She uses her head.I hate depended lead characters and Katniss was not one of them.While I can go on and on regarding my crush on Katniss, her male counterpart actually caught me too.Peeta Mellark, the baker boy who burned bread to give to his childhood crush. How sweet!Peeta was not as skilled as Katniss but he does everything to protect her nonetheless.Peeta.Peeta.Peeta.I hope you’re mine.You are a paradigm of a perfect boyfriend.Katniss and Peeta had perfect chemistry.You will always come across a book where the characters blend together perfectly.Katniss and Peeta were one of them.They were a smokin’ couple. (They were literally a smoking couple during the introduction of the tributes right? :D)Anyways, Peeta and Katniss were made to be together.I did have Katniss for hurting Peeta! Arrrg,I was told that the concept of the Hunger Games was not entirely original.I heard that somehow it was a bit similar to the Lord of Flies but I haven’t read that so I couldn’t say if it is true nor not but still I fell in love with the book either way.It was a mixture of everything I wanted and not knowing I wanted in one book.Not only did it have the action, romance, exceptional writing style that I wanted, I also felt there was a deeper meaning to the book that was hidden between the lines.The society that Katniss belonged to was very similar to the one that we have now.The status quo remained.District 12 symbolizes the underprivileged ones.It symbolizes the oppressed ones who didn’t have enough food to feed their families.It symbolizes the ones who had to take desperate measures to survive.The Capitol represents the rich people.They control the least fortunate ones with their money.They think they’re superior.I am not stereotyping.Not all rich people are bad while not all poor people are good either.It’s just a thought anyways.Don’t burn me at stake because I said that about the rich people. I know a lot of rich people who were more humble than me.I am not rich to make things clear.Hahaha.I’m part of District 12.Enough of that already.I didn’t know what came over me.THE HUNGER GAMES easily became my favorite.I’ve learned my lesson not to judge a book by its GENRE.If you are looking for an interesting read with a twist then I recommend this book.THE HUNGER GAMES did not disappoint.If this book could talk, I’m sure it will slap me in the face and say “Take that you b*tch for thinking that I am not worth your time reading!”Hahaha.I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES!I can’t wait for the movie.A PERFECT 5!PS:The movie is coming out next year.I thought the girl who played Katniss seemed to fit the part.I am just not too sure about the guy who played Peeta.I had a different Peeta in mind.Maybe Chace Crawford or Alex Pettyfer?Not expecting him.I thought Peeta was supposed to be blond anyways?!ARRRRR!I really can't wait for the movie!","Jul 10, 2011"

"9780439023481","23122552","Sally Howes","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23122552-sally-howes","Unless you've been living under a rock for the past five or six years, you already know that THE HUNGER GAMES has been a publishing and motion picture phenomenon. The book itself is a fast-paced, nail-biting, extremely compelling read, with an extraordinary premise and the kind of gritty, underdog characters that easily capture the reader's interest and emotions. But there is something more going on here, something that I dearly hope readers will take the time and effort to truly comprehend. If you are willing to actually scratch the surface of THE HUNGER GAMES, you will see it bleed.The feeling that there was something important that kept narrowly but consistently evading me dogged me throughout the book. At first, I thought it was just that there is something uniquely and profoundly chilling about watching a child deliberately hunt down and kill another child. That aspect of the book made me feel dirty, like someone who should be respectfully averting their gaze from a gruesome car crash but couldn't quite tear their eyes away. That was part of it, but it wasn't all of it. Next, I thought the thing that kept nagging at the edges of my mind had something to do with the grotesqueness of these young human sacrifices being first primped, pampered, and made into beautiful and desirable celebrities before being fed to the wolves. The cult of celebrity is something I abhor, and I could see in THE HUNGER GAMES a very apt and poignant allegory for the way in which young celebrities in particular are ""eaten alive"" by the entertainment industry. Yes, this was also part of it, but it still wasn't all of it.It wasn't until I read a short interview with the author at the end of the book that the final piece fell into place. In this interview, Suzanne Collins described what had first given her the idea for a story that became THE HUNGER GAMES. She had been sleepily channel surfing late one night and kept flipping back and forth between the images of a reality TV show in which children were competing for prizes or prestige and the images of a news report on child soldiers, an appallingly real condition that exists in many parts of our world today, in which children are forced to become soldiers fighting real wars against each other. That was when I finally realized exactly what I had found so unsettling about reading this book. It wasn't just the disturbing IDEA of children killing each other, it wasn't just what the book had to say, ALLEGORICALLY, about the ruthlessness of the cult of celebrity. No, what really made my skin crawl and my mind shrink back defensively as I read was the apparently subconscious knowledge that THE HUNGER GAMES IS NOT FICTION.The characters of this book may be invented, the plot of this book may be invented, the book may be set several centuries in the future, but the conditions under which this story develops are right here, right now. In THE HUNGER GAMES, some of the child sacrifices have trained their whole lives for the competition and enter it almost willingly, whereas others are simply forced to compete and enter the arena feeling nothing but terror. In some parts of our world, children compete in what they view as a willing manner for status, image, and celebrity, whereas in other parts of our world, children are kidnapped, contained in a certain area, and forced to either kill each other or be killed. These things are not fiction, these things are happening all day, every day. They're happening as you read this. They're happening as you wake up in the morning. They're still happening as you go to sleep at night.It's easy to read THE HUNGER GAMES with a chill running down your spine at the thought of children fighting to the death - for status or simply for their lives - but the reassuring thought in the back of your mind that ""It's just a story."" But as I finally came to realize, the most important thing about THE HUNGER GAMES is that it's NOT just a story. It's a very timely warning that at every moment, in every part of the world, we are allowing our children to be exploited in the most brutal, gruesome, and shameful ways imaginable - ways so shameful, in fact, that we can really only face up to them when they are presented to us in the guise of fiction.","Aug 25, 2013"
"9780439023481","349639","Argona","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/349639-argona","I wanted to read this book long time ago, literally years ago and yet I never did. Then the movie came out and I got annoyed. I had planned to read this eventually! And then there was this problem that I don't like watching the movie before reading the book. The book version is always my priority since some movies are capable of ruining amazing stories. And I can't enjoy a book with inaccurate spoilers chasing each other in my head. Anyway, I ended up watching the movie first and then I pushed myself into reading the book and despite knowing most of it, I ended up loving it. The movie is really good but I think it works better as a companion to the book. Everything has more depth and feeling in the book and there are very important details that aren't in the movie. I knew the events and I still cried when the little symbol of innocence perished and joined history.I really liked Katniss in this book. She was a strong heroine indeed. I liked her in the book better than the movie. In the movie, she is trying hard to be very cool while in the book, she is simply herself. An imperfect but strong 16 years old girl that still needs to grow. I could forgive her flaws considering her age and her situation. I liked the way her mind worked in this book. That she was antisocial, realistic and not very good with words.I am generally not a big fan of triangles but it didn't annoy me in this book and the story didn't focus on it. Thank god for that. I liked Gale, he is perhaps everything that many teenage girls find desirable but I couldn't help but love Peeta. The little boy with bread! He is perhaps too good to be true but I love him for this very reason. After all, a lot of things are a little unbelievable in this book. Why can't he be when it comes to his love for Katniss, the little girl who created the spark?I liked many of the supporting characters and while the story progressed, I came to really care about their fates. Creating interesting supporting characters with depth always wins me over. Effie, Haymitch, Rue, Cinna, Thresh...all of them are quite unforgettable. I have to mention that Effie and Rue gained very special places in my heart for being very different and unique characters.I really liked it that Katniss didn't become the spark by herself. She wouldn't have been as powerful without Cinna to dress her, Peeta to love her and Rue to seek her company. There is an entire world created in this book and characters equally influence each other. I love it when multiple characters work together to achieve something. It is really annoying when underage children save the world while all the adults hide under their beds. This wasn't the case here and I am grateful for that. The dystopia depicted in here isn't very realistic. I see a lot of problems with this government and the way it operates and frankly I don't understand how these districts did not rise against it much sooner but I tried to accept it and the book was well-written enough for me to immerse myself in the story. There is also the fact that most dystopian societies are symbolic and do have the tendency to exaggerate since they want to draw attention to certain issues and their consequences.I can also see the similarity with Battle Royale but I usually don't mind similarities that much as long as the story works and contains enough originality. I think it takes a lot of imagination and brilliance to build up a whole new world and a very different story line around a similar idea.You know what bugged me the most here? That years into the future, with all the technologies available, they still use WAX to remove extra body hair! WAX! Seriously Capitol? You don't have a painless permanent method? I am so disappointed in you. Hell, I am disappointed in humanity!With that out of my system, I will finish this review by saying that the story is gripping, emotional and hard to forget and I really enjoyed reading it. I believe in happy endings. I hope humanity wins this war and changes this violent cruel dystopia into a better place to live in. To hope and humanity!(And to something better than WAX!)","Aug 16, 2013"

That I’m more than just a piece in their Games.”-Peeta MellarkI was so tired of hearing about this series that I finally caved and decided to read it before the movies came out. This was hard for me to rate because I had mixed feelings the entire time I was reading. I knew I loved it and couldn't put it down, but I also knew it wouldn't be one of my all-time favorites. In the end, it was a 5-star experience for me because I absolutely loved the leads and I'm a sucker for dystopian. The plot was fast-paced and the whole story was just so intriguing. Katniss and Peeta were what made the story for me, and the ending just left me shocked and wanting more. Katniss was incredibly strong, clever, brave, and independent, but clueless when it came to Peeta, which was my one main gripe with her. And for the record, I am Team Peeta. But I digress...This made me think about many things, especially the problems that can arise with societal control, greed, power, and the innate human desire we possess to exert that control over others. It’s a strange and disturbing thing. But as humans, we’re bent toward the need for order and organization, or surely chaos will ensue. Yet that control and power becomes corrupted and chaos runs rampant in its own kind of madness. It's all kinds of creepy. What makes you YOU as a human being? When everything is stripped away and there's nothing in your life but the clothes on your back and the will to survive, what defines you? That being said...this is dystopian literature. It's dark. It's a tough subject. It's equally dark because it could almost happen. It's depressing. I've seen many people complain about this, yet they read it anyway. Personally, I will always root for dark, depressing storytelling when it has purpose. Because I always believe it says something. Something important. The darkness always tends to make the light even brighter--a blinding light, one you cannot avoid. It's not always easy to look at, but when you do, it's liberating. I sensed that kind of light the entire time I read this, which was why I appreciated it and why I'm officially a Hunger Games fan now. If you like Young Adult fiction, you are a dystopian fan, and you enjoy plots that make you think and keep you on the edge of your seat, give it a read. I'm on to book #2 now and can't wait for the first movie.Much love to my friend Melissa for the lend!","Nov 15, 2011"

Why? Because I’ve never been very good at marching in step with the rest of the crowd. Plus, as I write this, THE HUNGER GAMES occupies #9 of the Amazon Kindle eBooks Bestseller List for only the 840th day.So how did Suzanne Collins create this international party with a rabid group of followers? By writing a damn good novel, and despite catering to the YA crowd, she held nothing back with the violence, as she dropped it across the blood spattered pages. As for her main character Katniss Everdeen, she is the real hero of this story, and she’s the glue that holds this entire novel together. Without being inside of her head every second of this novel, the entire structure on which it is built would fall apart. You can claim that this should have been written in third person, and that it would have added suspense, as well as rounded out the other characters. But it would have changed the focus of the novel entirely, and it would have lacked immediacy. In order for first person to work successfully, a novel needs a strong, well-defined main character. Check and check.She does a great job with world-building, and I was sucked right into the kiddie pool with the surroundings, circumstances, characters, districts, and everything else that she so expertly articulated. So what if the love triangle is overdone? Without it, the story would have lacked heart. Besides, if you really want to talk plot, there are only seven basic plots, according to Cristopher Booker. Sure, this number ends up being a bit arbitrary, but it’s not like authors have an unlimited number of plots to choose from. So what it really boils down to is execution. Over and over again this book proves its point with Katniss, the quick flip of the pages (or push of the button for us Kindle users), the action scenes, how far we get into Katniss’s head, and the world-building. If you haven’t already hopped on THE HUNGER GAMES phenomenon, you better board the bus now, or you’re liable to miss out on the after-party.Cross-posted at Robert's Reads","Feb 09, 2012"

I was continuously waiting for myself to hate it, to see it as over hyped and yet I fell in love with the characters & Katniss' struggles and just wow. I can't wait to read catching fire.I FEEL SO BAD I NEVER WROTE MORE THAN THIS WOW, OKAY UPDATE TIME A WEEK LATER. So, while the writing wasn't prosy or flawless it managed to drag me in with its simplicity & occasional flares?? before this i had been reading poetry a lot and I have to admit the ease of this book was such a relief. I truly connected with Katniss in a few ways, especially the 'parenting her family' aspect and it hit me hard how I could truly understand her emotions. I think the icing on the top of this cake of a book is the characters, they are FLAWED you hear me? so damn beautifully flawed that they're effortlessly human. Now as I'm reading catching fire I'm seeing some flaws being dealt with correctly, characters learning to accept and fix their flaws and I'm just so amazed, I forgot what it's like to read a book with characters that feel human to me. Just the fact alone that Collins remembered to make her characters human was such an A+ for me. This book made me cry, it made me smile & it made me crave catching fire to the point I wanted to run to the store to pick up Catching Fire, I can 10000 percent see myself rereading this series again & again if the next two books are as good as this one.Now go off, and don't be me, don't be frightened by others opinions of popular books, give em a go for yourself!","Jan 04, 2017"

To some this amount of re-readings is most likely seen as excessive, but I truly love this story. The characters are so very deeply ingrained into me that I - at least upon the last three readings - cry at what most consider the most vile characters' deaths. (view spoiler)[Yes, that does include Cato and Clove and the boy that killed Rue. Never at President Snow's or Coin's deaths, however. Maybe one day, but yeah. I'd doubt it. (hide spoiler)]I concede that the recent HYPE absolutely engulfing this book had me on the fence as to whether I would even enjoy it anymore. (I attribute this to my very poignant hipster qualities.) But, as you will no doubt guess, this was my favorite of all the readings. I feel so attached to every one of the characters' thoughts, actions, and lives. I feel as if I still know what one character is doing even if Katniss is absorbed by something else. Honestly I don't read very many stories where I feel such a palpable connection but with this I do, and I cherish it.So, to all of you who are new to reading The Hunger Games, I encourage you to do so. I obviously cannot guarantee your entire enjoyment but I do think, especially if you plan on seeing the film, that giving it a go is a wise decision.","Jan 09, 2011"

The only reason I read this book now was because my name finally made it to the top of the library's waiting list. And the only reason I added my name to that list was because everyone else was reading it too and I'm a follower.

I really enjoyed this book- I think the story, whilst not entirely original- was clever and provided interesting commentary on the potential for cruelty within any society. The start was quite slow moving and whilst this could have been 'setting the scene', I just found it to be boring. Katniss is a beautiful and strong character. I think what made her so influential and inspirational was that she is so obviously flawed. She is thrown into a scenario and expected to be some kind of hero when, in reality, she is completely normal. I enjoyed her perspective; seeing how nervous she was and the impact the events of the Hunger Games had on her. It was very interesting. Also, I really don't understand how there is any debate about Team Peeta versus Team Gale. PEETA IS SO OBVIOUSLY THE BETTER CHOICE I MEAN JUST LOOK AT HIM HE IS SO ADORABLE AHHHHH!Overall this story is great and entertaining. Whilst it is not necessarily a difficult book to read, I think it is pretty special.","Jan 02, 2015"

I have to say, I didn't have to work at all at being unimpressed. The idea wasn't all that novel, the writing was mostly telling instead of showing, and wasn't even that good to boot. Too many awkward phrasings and grammatical errors. And maybe it was the lack of description and minimal emotional conveyance, but Katniss' narration was very underdeveloped, in that she wasn't nearly as angry or scared or mindful of her horrible situation as she should have been. Peeta seemed to have more complexity to him, but it's unsure how long that will last. And the rest of the characters barely get five pages to them before disappearing forever, so it's near impossible to judge them. I know it's YA, but I've read much better YA.

The story has just the perfect combination of action, drama, and romance. It has a great message that you can stay human even in the most inhumane conditions.Katniss is my favorite female character and one of the best heroines.

"9780439023481","6853965","Jacob J.","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6853965-jacob-j","Am I too late…?Despite its exposure and fame, I managed not to acquire any knowledge of this phenomenon prior to cracking the spine for the first time. The cover might as well have a Mr. Yuck sticker on it with that pendant and stupid crop-circle design that gives the mind-mirage of a story about child secret agents or something, like James Patterson for kids, or some Alex Rider nonsense. This was sufficient enough for quite some time to repel me. But now, let’s see what we’ve actually got here:Kid’s book about continentally broadcasted snuff film. Go on…I refuse (as best I can) to hold young adult fiction to a different standard than all other fiction. A younger demographic should not garner leniency or its corollary prejudice, critical brashness. I am not exemplary in keeping with this sentiment as my own predilections after experiences with household titles of the ‘genre’ like Twilight, and to some extent (apologies Hogwarts alumni) Harry Potter had become those of jadedness. I have been harboring a mentality of ‘kids-today’ intransigence (never mind that I was in fifth grade when the first Harry Potter book was published). So, I have a low standard for popular pre-teen series (I’m not suggesting this is anything more than incidental, but this realm tends to be dominated by female authors) and have come to expect scant substance in plot or character development. However, having indicted myself on that front and prefacing with that rather obvious point, I am pleased to say that I do not think Suzanne Collins treats her readers—young ones in particular—like idiots. Many of her readers were mere toddlers or infants on that infamous day in September of 2001, and have grown up in a world that is very distinguishable from the world we knew before; some are younger than the ongoing war in Afghanistan. They are coming of age in a world of increasing uncertainty, of static fear, and a minimal amount of hope. I was going to attempt to avoid any mention of the film, but allow me to offer one quote from the supercilious ‘President’ of Panem, Coriolanus Snow:  ""Hope; it's the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective, a lot of hope is dangerous.” Spoken like a true (and intelligent) dictator. Saddam could have learned something if only he’d clutched to power (and life) in time to hear it. This book speaks to the grimness of our future, hunger being something not many middle-class Americans (future Panemans?) consider very often. I’m not saying prophecy is at work, but the hardships and plights of these fictional citizens are not implausible in a foreseeable future of such scarce food, resource, and egis. As for ‘The Games’, just what would it take for a society to descend into such madness? Don’t get ahead of me. I won’t get too far into this, but there are risks society is comfortable with for the sake of entertainment right now, ladies and gentlemen. Has anyone died for our entertainment? American Football, UFC, Boxing, Professional Wrestling, NASCAR; I know I am not the first to suggest this, but I can hear the scoffs already. These enterprises don’t cite death as the objective of the game. But ask yourselves how many fans two-hand-touch football would have (HEADLINE: LOUISIANA SAINTS PLAYERS OFFERED $10,000 TO SHOVE OPPOSSING PLAYERS), or UCC (Ultimate Cuddling Challenge [okay, that’s essentially what the UFC is]). When something ‘goes wrong’ in these competitive sports, we talk about how sad and shocking it is, until we blithely sit down for the next game/match. I’m not making a social statement (although I could easily do without any of the aforementioned forms of entertainment) so much as suggesting that considering ourselves more civilized because we don’t intentionally kill people for entertainment purposes any longer may be slightly delusional. However thin and sophomoric this analogy may be, we do want real violence with real consequences for real people in our entertainment. It’s been inherent since, well, boredom (a pesky consequence of consciousness). I apologize, but this had to make it into a review somehow, sometime.In Defense of Inspiration and Doing Things That Have Been Done Before:Dystopian and post-apocalyptic scenarios in literature are nothing terribly groundbreaking any longer, but I haven’t heard too many critics making the claim that this book ‘rips off’ Brave New World or 1984. What else is there to focus on? Ah, yes, a pitting-against-each-other of young people with no personal qualms or vendettas against one another for the entertainment and disillusionment of the general populace who are collected, or “reaped” in a public display of revolutionary peacekeeping dominance and subjugation. What does that remind us of? Oh, right! Say it with me everyone! 
  Battle Royale
 Ancient Roman Gladiatorial Combat! (I won’t get into this again). Indeed there are blatant literary hack jobs, for which the words ‘inspired by’ may absolutely not be applied. There are also retellings (Ulysses and O’ Brother Where Art Thou are masterful and imaginative in their own respective rights without even needing to evoke anything Homeric). We recognize the source, judge with equanimity, and conclude based on what they bring to the story, or what source elements they use to enhance or upgrade their own story. We do not (I speak optimistically) fling accusatory excrement of imitation or fraudulence simply because comparisons can be drawn between something and something else. I cannot speak as to whether or not Collins drew any direct inspiration from Koushun Takami (or Ancient Rome), but this book appears to be neither a hack job nor a riding-on-the-coattails of anything that preceded it.O Katniss! My Katniss!:Spoilers may follow, but I am reasonably sure that I am the last person on Goodreads to read this book, so…""This is an okay place to die” the refreshingly imperfect heroine thinks to herself, arousing unexpected affection from yours truly. In this particular instance, she makes the best of the environment she finds herself in as darkness seems to be closing in on her. If there is ever that chance that it will be the end, it is easy to focus on what could be the last scent, or sensation one experiences. The fatigue, the accumulated stress and piled-on pain, the anguish and concealed desperation (not to mention the sleep deprivation the night before ‘The Games’ begin). It is all conveyed by Katniss with such vulnerable clarity that simple human empathy is only the first stage in coming to relate to her. Her second-guessing w/r/t everything Peeta says, or does (including saving her life) is significant beyond the context of wanting to survive. Her anxiety over these matters is no idle inner monologue, but validates for us our precarious dispositions when considering ulterior motives when someone pays us a kindness. These neuroses are not always justified, but they are unavoidable as dictated by our nature; one of those refreshing imperfections I was referring to above. I will gloss over the less-than-necessary love triangle aspect as it seems to be the prominent point of ridicule for the more ‘serious’ readers (albeit I could think of reasons to defend it). The first person narrative grants us privy access to Katniss’ every thought, but the ending of this first installment is one of romantic ambiguity nonetheless. We haven’t learned Peeta’s true feelings by this point either, but I am among the, shall we say, more mature masses that cares naught for this—what I would deem—subplot. Katniss doesn’t need a man, but she is allowed to fall for one if her emotions and hormones so incline her to. Katniss is not out for blood; she is a reticent, unintentional badass, which is the only kind worthy of the title.Some Complaints (not involving love triangle):I made a joke as I neared the end of the novel. “When do the vampires come in?” I cynically asked. Little did I know that werewolf-like creatures were soon to make their debut. I didn’t hate the implementation (and it was better than what the film did), and upon realizing that they were, in fact, the reanimated, mutated corpses of her former adversaries (and sweet, furry little Rue), Katniss was provided with further existential speculation. Did these creatures want revenge, did they possess the memories along with the molecules of their (former?) selves, or are they autonomous killing machines? Also, what the hell happened to them after they scampered off? Perhaps I’ll find out. But!... but, beyond that it came off as more teen-pandering fantasy fare that detracted from the realistic elements I had hitherto gotten used to. I realize the novel is often classified as sci-fi, but this stretched the limits of my suspension of disbelief. Muttations; I suppose the pun works, though.Then, when ‘The Games’ are finished and Claudius Templesmith revokes his previous announcement that two winners will be allowed (dun, dun, dun!) and Katniss has the brilliant idea of a faux-suicide-pact, prompting Claudius to revoke his revocation in a graceless sort of wait, just kidding, fine, gosh! way, it just didn’t work. I understand it was meant to transmit humiliation for ‘The Capitol’, but it really came off as Collins pulling off a last-ditch effort at a final twist (of the most expected and trite variety). Unless it was meant to be religious satire (Abraham, Isaac, a goat, God, you know) it was not a particularly meaningful note to end the violence on. No gasps were induced. A yawn was too much to muster.I’ll cut myself off there with those couple examples. The book has flaws, but they were not so numerous or egregious that it ruined the overall experience. The writing quality has its flaws just like the plot, but it’s pretty damn good for the most part. It is mostly straightforward storytelling, but doesn’t slouch on elegant, effective prose that youngsters can understand:""I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me. All the things I dread for others manifest in such vivid detail I can’t help but believe they’re real.”A Quick and Concluding Thought on Politics:I can’t help but think that the political allegory, which can be interpreted into any narrative, is rather overstated, if not mostly unfounded (to say nothing of the liberal-conservative ‘debate’ since the film’s release of whose ideals it best represents). The things I discussed in my opening statements are not inherent in this story, rather what I gathered when I read into it. They logically follow, I believe, from what the story itself forthrightly presents us with, but to read this as some kind of WARNING for our future, save for the conceivable degeneration of risk-taking entertainment into near-deliberate killing, is sailing out to sea a little bit. I may be starting to contradict myself, so I will take my leave.May the force be ever with your favor. Oops…","Mar 18, 2012"
"9780439023481","695116","Jim","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim","I've heard a lot about this & was pretty excited to find it on audio book. Maybe too excited because it was a bit of a let down. I saw the movie & it was OK The book was better in many ways, but suffered from 2 composition issues that were irritating; the reader, Carolyn McCormick, has too high of a voice for me, & the story is almost completely in first person present tense. McCormick's voice is well trained, the only saving grace, but it was like listening to one of the Chipmunks for hours on end. I recently read an article where an author mentioned reading a manuscript that was all in the present tense (""I say"" instead of ""I said""). I believe the comment was that it was artsy, but wearing. I didn't really understand, until I listened to this & I agree completely. A friend suggested that it limited the character's, thus our understanding. We get the raw information before it has been processed. I think he's right, but it's not reason enough, IMO.The world itself was simplified in an interesting way to break up civilization into districts that each performed one function. That wasn't too hard to swallow until (view spoiler)[ the population of District 12 is given as 8000 people, all using 1 village, the entire coal producing area for the North American continent. That's just too few people & districts. (hide spoiler)] It forced me to realize that it was an artificial device rather than a realistic future. As it was, it focused my attention on the improbability & didn't do the story any favors, especially in light of the practically magical science that is displayed. (view spoiler)[ Beast clone/constructs created from the contestants in so short a time? The practical omniscient ability of the cameras to capture everything? Parachutes with gifts that seemed to always hit their mark, no matter what the weather or timing? Complete control of the weather to the point that a storm was switched off like a light? (hide spoiler)] Practically magical, yet it played surprisingly well.The main event are the children fighting to the death & that was very well done - 5 star material. The land was well used, the heroine well suited & believably trained. Her thought processes during the hunts & escapes were great. The author never crowded too much into the time or the characters. Everyone got tired, thirsty, & hungry. Their advantages & weaknesses were well used.This is a YA book, so there was no sex, but hinged on romance, a very fine line to walk. Katniss was 16, a bit too old to believably pull this off. A year or two younger would have sat much better with me, especially given the complete lack of religion or any other moral structure within the book. That forces me to substitute my own & I can't imagine any 16 year old who (view spoiler)[ runs around in the woods constantly with a boy not experimenting with sex. She knows him well enough to compare his warmth & heartbeat at one point, yet neither has even kissed. Completely unbelievable to me.  (hide spoiler)] They're nothing like any teenager of that age that I've known & I raised 3 not terribly long ago. Still, this wasn't a terrible suspension of belief, but it did nag at me consistently.However, the romance was one of the main, best, & most suspenseful pieces of the story. It also added a layer of complexity that was truly wonderful & gave the story far more latitude than it otherwise would have had. Excellently done!I really enjoyed the book until the end. I'd guess that the author or the editor suddenly decided this shouldn't be a stand-alone, but a trilogy because the final twist felt tacked on & was unrealistic. It not only carries, but becomes the reason for the next novel where it felt so contrived that I couldn't continue. (view spoiler)[ For the Games Masters to suddenly reverse their decision for a single winner made no sense. While Katniss continually tells us the reason for the games is to rub the districts' collective noses in their position, it's obviously more complex than that. She's a kid & not a completely reliable narrator, especially in the area of politics. A win gives a district hope, throws the people a bone. I don't see the up side of such a decision.If I swallow that they just made a bad decision - possible - I'm still facing the aftermath. Peeta is saved only by extraordinary means. Why would they bother? It would have been better for him to die, especially since this supposedly becomes a rallying point of insurrection. Instead, the Games department seems to be at odds with the dictator, President Snow. And, in the next book, Snow actually does his own dirty work, makes his own threats. Seriously? He has no left hand man or people on the inside in such a paranoid society? Even a senior Peace Keeper to give a warning about Katniss keeping up her act with Peeta? Please! (hide spoiler)]Anyway, the very end just hit me like a train wreck which was a shame. I'm going to give the next book, Catching Fire, a chance to wash away the bad taste.","Jan 20, 2013"

  “Lo cojo de la mano con fuerza, preparándome para las cámaras y temiendo el momento en que no me quede más remedio que dejarlo marchar.”
The Hunger Games no necesita introducción. Yo me enteré que este libro existía gracias a mi hermana que, cuando escuchó que yo no había leído el libro ese en el que adolescentes y niños se matan unos a otros, me miró con cara de WTF?!, y me dijo que lo hiciera inmediatamente. Al igual que con Harry Potter, llegué tarde a esta tendencia. The Hunger Games es un buen libro, pero no el mejor. A mí parecer, Suzanne Collins botó a la basura buenas oportunidades para el desarrollo de personajes. Eso se debe a que el libro está escrito en primera persona; narrado por Katniss Everdeen, una joven del Distrito 12 de Panem, quien debe enfrentarse a los 
  Juegos del Hambre
 en lugar de su hermana. Sin duda Katniss es una protagonista muy fuerte, decidida y tenaz. Sin embargo, Katniss para mí fue muy distante y retraía. Lo único que a ella le importaba era su familia, y eso lo puedo entender; pero creo que Katniss no sintió nada al matar a esos tributos durante los juegos. ¡Pero ellos eran sus enemigos! Sí, pero aquellos tributos también eran como ella: títeres del Capitolio Sigo pensando que si la historia mostrara más profundidad en cada personaje -no sólo Katniss-, nadie odiaría tanto a Cato y a otros del grupo de los profesionales. 
  “Antes de que nadie pudiese ver lo que había pasado, me metí los panes debajo de la camisa, me tapé bien con la chaqueta de cazador y me alejé corriendo. Aunque el calor del pan me quemaba la piel, los agarré con más fuerza, aferrándome a la vida.”
Si hubiese leído primero Battle Royale de Koushun Takami, probablemente mi rating para The Hunger Games sería menos de tres estrellas. Collins supo diferenciar su libro al agregarle el toque de los medios de comunicación. Mi problema con esta trama es el siguiente: me cuesta creer que en setenta y cuatro Juegos del Hambre ningún distrito se haya pronunciado en contra del Capitolio, especialmente cuando en las cosechas escogen a niñas como Prim y Rue. 
  Si yo fuese madre, haría TODO lo posible para acabar con esos bastardos.
 Simplemente no me creo que un padre se quede cruzado de brazos viendo todos los santos años cómo niños se matan entre ellos. (Sólo el Distrito 13 lo hizo, y el Capitolio muy firmemente les recuerda al resto de los distritos de Panem lo que les ocurrirá si siguen el ejemplo del 13.) El romance me aburrió. Si les soy sincera, NUNCA creí que Katniss estuviera enamorada de Peeta. O sea, él le salvó la vida, nada más. Nunca vi ese momento que me dijera Oh, él la ama; ella le ama. Simplemente porque Katniss era la narradora, y ella sólo pensaba en su familia. Además, Katniss no sabía que Peeta y Gale estaban enamorados de ella y, cuando el primero lo confiesa ante todo Panem, la muy boba cree que lo hace sólo para hacerla ver débil. Esa parte la vi venir desde las primeras páginas. Otro aspecto que me pareció muy descuidado fue la escritura. Collins escribe de una manera en la que el libro se vuelve lento pero rápido. No sé si me explico, pero durante esta lectura la mitad del libro se me hizo muy lento, y la otra mitad se fue en un santiamén. Además, me faltó un poco más de introducción. Collins en pocas páginas cuenta la historia de la creación de Panem y Los Juegos del Hambre; luego utiliza casi un capítulo entero para mostrar el embellecimiento de Katniss: cómo la depilan, la maquillan y todo eso. Esas páginas me parecieron absolutamente innecesarias. En resumen, The Hunger Games fue una buena lectura. Nada emocionante ni especial para mí. Yo hubiese cambiado ciertas cosas que, a mí parecer, sobraban del libro, tales como: el triángulo amoroso, y la narradora de la historia. Para mí, a The Hunger Games le faltó mucho para ser el libro.","Jul 24, 2013"
"9780439023481","1009267","Meg","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1009267-meg","I'm not sure if I was having an acute fit of literary snobbery or just PMSing, but this is clearly not a 3-star book (as I originally rated it). I re-read it in anticipation of the last two movies, and it's a 5-star all the way!Also, could it be possible that the movies are so awesome they make the books read better? Movie or book - which one lends the other its awesomeness? Hmm... kind of a chicken and egg conundrum. I'll include the original review below... just to keep myself humble.---------------I'm pleased to announce yet another category in the competition for Meg's Literary Honor Awards (only slightly less prestigious than the Nobel)--and that category is... drumroll... Sissiest Male Character Names in the History of Time! And the uncontested winner... you guessed it... the ever-effeminating Hunger Games! (alas, my Spell Check informs me that ""effeminating"" is not a word, but I must insist). Which strapping young man will Katniss choose to spend her life with? Peeta or Gale? Perhaps her mentor Cinna can help her choose (yes, Cinna also has a Y chromosome). And the big, bad villain--striking fear into the hearts of all Hunger Games contestants? Cato. That's right, Cato--a name which, no matter how many weapons proficiencies he carries, will ever remind me of a pansy, Fabio look-a-like on a witness stand.Other than the severely EFFEMINATING names chosen (darn you, Spell Check!)--which at least served to bring me a hearty chuckle every three pages or so--this book was pretty decent. Most of you would probably consider it a 4. A good survival tale action flick in a futuristic Coliseum of sorts, where 12 boys and 12 girls between the ages of 12 and 18 compete to the death. The winner gets food for their home district. The loser gets... well, death, because that's what a fight to the death means. Personally, I LOVED the protagonist Katniss--she displayed all the testosterone lacking in her male counterparts (and their names)--but she spent entirely too much time on her own. The book is almost completely bereft of dialogue, which is my favorite literary device, so it lost a couple of stars for me personally. But don't take my word for it! Others seem to love it, so read on! It is, after all, an award winner.FAVORITE QUOTES: ""District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety."" (Katniss)So instead of acknowledging applause, I stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage. Silence. Which says we do not agree. We do not condone. All of this is wrong.We're going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won't seem sincere if I'm trying to slit his throat.""They're already taking my future! They can't have the things that mattered to me in the past!"" (Katniss)The arenas are historic sites preserved after the Games. Popular destinations for Capitol residents to visit, to vacation. Go for a month, rewatch the Games, tour the catacombs, visit the sites where the deaths took place. You can even take part in reenactments. They say the food is excellent.""Destroying things is much easier than making them."" (Katniss)I climb dangerously high into a tree, not for safety but to get as far away from today as I can.","Jan 07, 2009"
"9780439023481","1327790","Blandine","https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1327790-blandine","After the whole Twilight fiasco – the most infuriating yet hilarious saga I’ve held in my hands – I was not particularly willing to give the whole young adult genre another try any time soon. But when a dear friend more than enthusiastically told me about The Hunger Games and kindly lent me her copy, I began my reading optimistically and hoping I would love the first volume of the trilogy.The Hunger Games is set in a post-apocalyptic America called Panem. Governed by the dictatorial Capitol, Panem was separated into thirteen districts. After District 13 rebelled, it was wiped off the map and the Hunger Games were set to punish the inhabitants of Panem. Taking place every year, two children from each remaining district aged between 12 and 18 are chosen to fight for their lives in the games – which are televised for everyone to see. The last one standing will be declared the winner. In the first book, Katniss Everdeen, 16, enters the game instead of her beloved young sister Prim, whose name was originally picked randomly.I was seduced by the storyline in the first place; it came across as a sort of new 1984 aimed at teenagers/young adults which, in our sad days of real TV and empty celebrities, could only make them question the state of society. However I have the silly tendency to be slightly naive at times.While I will not reproach Suzanne Collins anything in terms of writing style – I was not shocked by its mediocrity but wouldn’t praise it for hours on either – I have to say The Hunger Games felt like a major let-down. I do believe she tried to create a strong, independent female character with Katniss, only the latter came across as so irritating to me. As I was reading, I kept wondering why so: what was it about Katniss that bothered me so much? How was I going to express it? And the thing is, I think she oozes false modesty. She goes on and on about how she never does anything for herself, how she’s so devoted to her family and friends that she always makes herself come last to assure herself they’ll be alright, how she’s strong despite all the bad around her… And so on and so forth. So much so that in the end, she comes across as the most self-centred person in the book despite her trying to achieve the complete opposite. If she only admitted that she needs to survive and that yes, surviving does require a little selfishness, she would be much less annoying as far as I’m concerned. Don’t even get me started about the whole “we’re in love” pseudo-pretence!As a result of that, while the book could’ve been about an empowered young girl – which Katniss surely is to a certain extent – it was really about a whining brat who, I kept hoping, would be killed off brutally! The only reason I finished the book was because of my friend and because I kept hoping I’d suddenly like it. Alas!It left me wondering, though, about female heroines: isn’t it time we had more Hermione Grangers and fewer Bellas? It is now 2012 and women, in theory, can do anything. Yet it seems that female writers find it impossible to detach themselves from the old condition of women. Feed young girls with incredible heroines who kick arse and are truly empowered, for god’s sake!","Feb 12, 2012"

The story follows Katniss Everdeen through the United Sates region. This story takes place in the somewhat distant future after a catastrophic event took place leaving the land scared and baron of life. Ms. Everdeen lives in District Twelve, one of the districts that is part of this dystopian society.The story starts out in District Twelve, Katniss is Just outside of the district's chain-link fences hunting for game to help feed her family, and to sell at the black market. The main reason for her having to do this is that, District Twelve is the poorest of the districts, many people barely getting anything at all to eat. It just so happens that this day is reaping day, the day each year where the Capitol would put the names of children, one boy and one girl from each district (age twelve through eighteen), would be randomly selected to be entered into the annual Hunger Games. The people chosen from District Twelve were Peeta Malark and Katniss's little sister. Katniss was devastated by this and volunteered to take her place. She is then taken to the capital to prepare for the games. She was given some training at the capital before her, and the other 23 people in the games, were tested on their abilities. Katniss, being an experienced hunter, her primary weapon being a bow, was some how able to get the highest score, making her a definite target. The following day the games started, and many were killed in the initial beginning. Katniss had endured many hardships whilst participating. She had forged allies, and lost nearly all of them. at the end of the games, having been previously promised to be allowed to win if both people from one district were still alive. She was then told that, that was no longer the case. Outraged by this, she decided to take poison at the same time Peeta did, this caused the people of the capitol to allow them both to live. I found this story to be rather interesting, taking a unique point of view on dystopian societies that I have never seen before. It would always leave me wanting more, and returning it ten fold. What I believe the overall theme of this book is that, people are too exposed to the terrible things in the world, and it's gotten to the point of entertainment. While I do believe that this is true in our society, I don't believe that we should stop allowing people to know what is happening in the world, though we most certainly shouldn't consider it entertainment, some defiantly do. This is not good, and I like how the author has raised such a point, even if I don't completely agree with it.In conclusion, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins, is a pretty good book, raising interesting points and taking unique views. I found this book to be both entertaining and intellectually challenging. I would recommend this book to either High-School students of College students as it has situations in it that, many people much younger than that, would not be able to fully comprehend what is happening. This book was most certainly one of my favorite books that I've ever had the pleasure of reading, and I highly recommend that you read it.","Oct 17, 2013"

L'ho finito dopo aver letto tutto il pomeriggio per sei ore consecutive. Non mi succedeva dai tempi di ""The Lost Hero"" di Rick Riordan. Sarà che i libri in inglese con un target d'età adolescenziale (il romanzo della Collins però può interessare a qualsiasi persona, adulti compresi) mi prendono particolarmente. Il fatto è che staccarsene era impossibile.Allora, abbiamo questa città del futuro composta da 13 distretti. Il tredicesimo si è ribellato anni addiettro, e la città (Panem), per punire tutti i distretti e ricordare loro che non bisogna ribellarsi, ha creato gli Hunger Games, un tv show dove ragazzi e ragazze di età compresa tra i 12 e 18 anni, due per distretto, si affrontano in un'arena enorme fino alla morte. L'ultimo che rimane vince. La Collins crea la storia sul pretesto dell'amore fraterno tra la protagonista, Katniss Everdeen, e la sorella, Primrose Everdeen, di soli dodici anni.Il giorno in cui i partecipanti dei nuovi Hunger Games vengono chiamati, accade l'inaspettabile: viene estratta Primrose Everdeen. E Katniss si offre volontaria al suo posto, perché l'amore per la sorella è la cosa più cara che ha al mondo.La storia è avvincente, mai noiosa, non c'è una parola di troppo. Si nota forse un po' la mano femminile, ma sono rimasto soddisfatto dalle scene che ha creato la Collins, sebbene rimanga dell'idea che una mano maschile le avrebbe rese ancora più cruente e più godibili. Dov'è c'è da emozionarsi ci si emoziona, dove c'è da trattenere il respiro lo si trattiene, e così via.È comprensibile che i punti forza dell'autrice sono lo stile diretto e lineare, privo di fronzoli, la suspence che non smette un solo secondo. E poi ci pensi, ci pensi tanto. Fa' riflettere, a suo modo.Anche il finale è perfetto, lascia una voglia folle di mettere subito le mani sul seguito (che guarda caso ho già, e anche il terzo) per sapere cosa succederà. Il libro è abbastanza autoconclusivo, ma la storia è ben lungi dall'essere finita. Direi promossa a pieni voti la Collins, e ora si aspetta il film!","Jun 29, 2011"

Stell dir vor, Nordamerika existiert nicht mehr und das, was noch nicht durch Kriege zerstört ist, teilt sich in 12 Destrikte auf, über die das Capitol mit eiserner und unglaublich grausamer Hand herrscht. Stell dir vor, dass jedes Jahr so genannte Hungerspiele veranstaltet werden, an denen je ein Junge und ein Mädchen aus jedem der 12 Destrikte teilnehmen muss, um alle daran zu erinnern, dass sie sich nie wieder gegen das Capitol auflehnen sollen, wenn sie nicht so enden wollen, wie es einst bei der Zerstörung von Distrikt 13 der Fall war.Und nun stell dir vor, dass die Hungerspiele im Grunde nichts anderes sind als öffentliche Hinrichtungen von unschuldigen Kindern. Dass das gesamte Geschehen, das in der Arena, in die die 24 Tribute gebracht werden, live im Fernsehen übertragen wird und dass die Eltern, Geschwister, Freunde und auch alle anderen, die die Tribute kennen, dabei zusehen müssen, wie sie sterben. Wie sie von Mutationen, die das Capitol erschaffen hat, niedergemetzelt werden. Oder von Mittributen, die nur noch an den Sieg und das Überleben denken können - oder die verrückt geworden sind. Willkommen in der Welt von Katniss Everdeen, Tribut der 74.

I was so eager to read this book in advance, and thanks to a fellow Goodreads member, I received and read a hardcover edition more than two months before the official publication date. I had great fun reading it early and I’m grateful for the opportunity, but now the problem is that I’ll have an even longer wait for the publication of the next two books in the trilogy. I’ll feel the suspense until I know the whole story. This book is a fine self-contained book, although if I hadn’t been aware that there were two upcoming sequels, I’d have thought that it ended too abruptly.I loved this book. I was completely entranced. Suzanne Collins does a marvelous job of not only creating a fully developed alternate world but of making me feel as though I was right there, and there are so many memorable characters, especially the main character who tells the story in first person, a sixteen year old girl named Katniss. One small quibble I have is that Katniss was possibly just slightly too articulate and perspicacious given her background (she has attended school but must work hard to support her family and lives with inadequate nutrition in dire poverty in the most destitute of 13 areas of her nation) but that’s a minor quibble, especially since her story telling is so enjoyable. I would recommend this book for only those who are 12 years old & up, and not for younger kids, because of the type of violence and the ages of those in danger of dying: 12-18, and because of the general dark theme.","May 14, 2008"

Very intriguing premise that immediately reminded me of Stephen King's Bachman novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Speaking of the man, Stevie gives this a rave review in Entertainment Weekly available on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Hunger-Games-Su...So this book does not disappoint. It's high octane energy from start to finish. The writing is a bit sophomoric at times, but that's reasonable to expect given the age of the protagonist (16)and the book's intended adolescent audience. Bottom line: great story idea executed with finesse. Suzanne Collins isn't inventing anything new here, but she is obviously comfortable trodding such familiar, dystopian territory and making it her own. There's definitely strong hints of King's early Bachman work, and I couldn't help be reminded of Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"". How could I not? Is The Hunger Games classic dystopian literature then?...a Lord of the Flies or Long Walk? Absolutely not, but I still had a helluva good time reading it. With reality TV everywhere we look these days, and the UFC a mainstream pastime, it's easy to imagine a Survivor where tribe members voted out don't go home, but are executed instead.

The story is entrancing and so amazingly detailed. The characters are relatable. I love the fact that the end makes you ABSOLUTELY CRAZY to know what in the world happens. I really like the love triangle because it's not nearly as cliché as most. She (Katniss) really is stuck between two amazing choices for a boyfriend/husband. I also love how that isn't the focus of the story, but a sort of juicy side dish to the main course: the games. The games are amazingly thought out and indescribably well written. Suzanne writes about something so incredibly horrible and gory and just absolutely revolting-but you just want to read on and on! The fact that children are hunting and killing children is disgusting but Suzanne makes it interesting and very entertaining. Suzanne also does a great job of making you HATE Panem andIt's leaders.

The country has been divided into twelve districts governed by a capital which seems to be in the Rocky Mountains. As punishment for the rebellion that led to war and the destruction of the US, every district must send tributes to compete in The Hunger Games. One boy and one girl, chosen by lottery, must fight the other tributes to the death until only one survives.The Minotaur myth meets Survivor...I liked that the book dealt honestly with the bleakness of life in the districts and the hopelessness of survival of the young tributes. The book was surprisingly uplifting, in large part due to Collins' well-drawn, sympathetic characters.I did not give the book 5 stars because the resolution left me unsatisfied, it so obviously sets the stage for a sequel.

I can't believe people are hooked to this. The major turnoff for me was the writing. It was worse than reading the nutritional facts of a canned tuna or the side effects of a pill. The plot would have made a good movie, I am sure. But because the writing fails to stir any excitement it was lost on me. Also, I did not think that the plot is original. Why? Because I've seen too many movies like this; only this had a different version.But I did manage to trudge my way through the first book; I bought a boxed set (sadly) and after finishing the fist book or rather griping to finish it, I let the other 2 books rest for awhile.

The Hunger Games has a special place in my heart. It is one of the books that triggered my desire to read novels (I read books, yes, but I prefer textbooks over novels during my school years). I was honestly obsessed to this book and still I am right now.I learned about Hunger Games when I'm searching I-don't-know-what and tumbled across in a post stated it will turn into a movie. After that, I searched what this book is all about. I was curious, what I found out wasn't enough so I sought for a copy and when I've got a copy I started reading and I can't stop reading. Goodness gracious. I was enthralled, compelled, engaged, hooked, captivated whatsoever. The plot was so addictive. I was thrilled by the action and the suspense sheltering in it.

This story takes place in the nation of Panem, which is divided into twelve districts (the thirteenth tried to rebel and was destroyed). The Hunger Games take place for the purpose of reminding each district that rebellion is pointless... until Katniss chooses to particpate.I loved this book, it was really really addicting. There was a lot of action and some romance, as well as adventure and drama. Katniss was a likeable narrator, and her conflicts, internal and external, were both believeable and well written.

I enjoyed the establishing chapters, finding the sense of place and mood and political situation to be pretty compelling. And the games themselves were appropriately brutal and darkly realized. Where it went off the rails a bit for me was in Suzanne Collins' depiction of Katniss's voice. When I'm reading a first-person narrative, I really want to feel like it's the character, and not the author, speaking to me, and in this case it never fully clicked that it was Katniss's authentic voice. Also, (slight spoiler alert), the handling of her feelings -- or lack of feelings -- for Peeta didn't track for me in an honest way, and I was a bit disappointed to see the story devolve into a not very fully realized possible romantic triangle.
